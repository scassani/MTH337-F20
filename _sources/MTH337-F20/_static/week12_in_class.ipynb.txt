      "researches and discoveries of modern science to the popular taste,\r\n",
      "which demands that these should be presented to ordinary readers in\r\n",
      "the lighter form of cleverly mingled truth and fiction, these books\r\n",
      "will assuredly be read with profit and delight, especially by English\r\n",
      "youth. Certainly no writer before M. Jules Verne has been so happy in\r\n",
      "weaving together in judicious combination severe scientific truth\r\n",
      "with a charming exercise of playful imagination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Iceland, the starting point of the marvellous underground journey\r\n",
      "imagined in this volume, is invested at the present time with a\r\n",
      "painful interest in consequence of the disastrous eruptions last\r\n",
      "Easter Day, which covered with lava and ashes the poor and scanty\r\n",
      "vegetation upon which four thousand persons were partly dependent for\r\n",
      "the means of subsistence. For a long time to come the natives of that\r\n",
      "interesting island, who cleave to their desert home with all that\r\n",
      "_amor patriae_ which is so much more easily understood than\r\n",
      "explained, will look, and look not in vain, for the help of those on\r\n",
      "whom fall the smiles of a kindlier sun in regions not torn by\r\n",
      "earthquakes nor blasted and ravaged by volcanic fires. Will the\r\n",
      "readers of this little book, who, are gifted with the means of\r\n",
      "indulging in the luxury of extended beneficence, remember the\r\n",
      "distress of their brethren in the far north, whom distance has not\r\n",

      "is scarcely to be expected in a work in which the element of\r\n",
      "amusement is intended to enter more largely than that of scientific\r\n",
      "instruction, that any great degree of accuracy should be arrived at.\r\n",

      "On the 24th of May, 1863, my uncle, Professor Liedenbrock, rushed\r\n",
      "into his little house, No. 19 Königstrasse, one of the oldest streets\r\n",
      "in the oldest portion of the city of Hamburg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Martha must have concluded that she was very much behindhand, for the\r\n",
      "dinner had only just been put into the oven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, now,\" said I to myself, \"if that most impatient of men is\r\n",
      "hungry, what a disturbance he will make!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"M. Liedenbrock so soon!\" cried poor Martha in great alarm, half\r\n",
      "opening the dining-room door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, Martha; but very likely the dinner is not half cooked, for it\r\n",
      "is not two yet. Saint Michael's clock has only just struck half-past\r\n",
      "one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then why has the master come home so soon?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps he will tell us that himself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here he is, Monsieur Axel; I will run and hide myself while you\r\n",
      "argue with him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Martha retreated in safety into her own dominions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was left alone. But how was it possible for a man of my undecided\r\n",
      "turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the\r\n",
      "Professor? With this persuasion I was hurrying away to my own little\r\n",
      "retreat upstairs, when the street door creaked upon its hinges; heavy\r\n",
      "feet made the whole flight of stairs to shake; and the master of the\r\n",
      "house, passing rapidly through the dining-room, threw himself in\r\n",
      "haste into his own sanctum.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into\r\n",
      "a corner, his rough broadbrim upon the table, and these few emphatic\r\n",
      "words at his nephew:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Axel, follow me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had scarcely had time to move when the Professor was again shouting\r\n",
      "after me:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! not come yet?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I rushed into my redoubtable master's study.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Otto Liedenbrock had no mischief in him, I willingly allow that; but\r\n",
      "unless he very considerably changes as he grows older, at the end he\r\n",
      "will be a most original character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was professor at the Johannæum, and was delivering a series of\r\n",
      "lectures on mineralogy, in the course of every one of which he broke\r\n",
      "into a passion once or twice at least. Not at all that he was\r\n",
      "over-anxious about the improvement of his class, or about the degree\r\n",
      "of attention with which they listened to him, or the success which\r\n",
      "might eventually crown his labours. Such little matters of detail\r\n",
      "never troubled him much. His teaching was as the German philosophy\r\n",
      "calls it, 'subjective'; it was to benefit himself, not others. He was\r\n",
      "a learned egotist. He was a well of science, and the pulleys worked\r\n",
      "uneasily when you wanted to draw anything out of it. In a word, he\r\n",
      "was a learned miser.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Germany has not a few professors of this sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To his misfortune, my uncle was not gifted with a sufficiently rapid\r\n",
      "utterance; not, to be sure, when he was talking at home, but\r\n",
      "certainly in his public delivery; this is a want much to be deplored\r\n",
      "in a speaker. The fact is, that during the course of his lectures at\r\n",
      "the Johannæum, the Professor often came to a complete standstill; he\r\n",
      "fought with wilful words that refused to pass his struggling lips,\r\n",
      "such words as resist and distend the cheeks, and at last break out\r\n",
      "into the unasked-for shape of a round and most unscientific oath:\r\n",
      "then his fury would gradually abate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now in mineralogy there are many half-Greek and half-Latin terms,\r\n",
      "very hard to articulate, and which would be most trying to a poet's\r\n",
      "measures. I don't wish to say a word against so respectable a\r\n",
      "science, far be that from me. True, in the august presence of\r\n",
      "rhombohedral crystals, retinasphaltic resins, gehlenites, Fassaites,\r\n",
      "molybdenites, tungstates of manganese, and titanite of zirconium,\r\n",
      "why, the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It therefore happened that this venial fault of my uncle's came to be\r\n",
      "pretty well understood in time, and an unfair advantage was taken of\r\n",
      "it; the students laid wait for him in dangerous places, and when he\r\n",
      "began to stumble, loud was the laughter, which is not in good taste,\r\n",
      "not even in Germans. And if there was always a full audience to\r\n",
      "honour the Liedenbrock courses, I should be sorry to conjecture how\r\n",
      "many came to make merry at my uncle's expense.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Two o'clock struck. This was becoming ridiculous; worse than that,\r\n",
      "unbearable. I began to say to myself that I was exaggerating the\r\n",

      "harm came of it. A smile flitted across the lip of my severe\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing easier. I received not long ago a map from my friend,\r\n",
      "Augustus Petermann, at Liepzig. Nothing could be more apropos. Take\r\n",
      "down the third atlas in the second shelf in the large bookcase,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I rose, and with the help of such precise instructions could not fail\r\n",
      "to find the required atlas. My uncle opened it and said:\r\n",

      "\"You see this volcanic island,\" said the Professor; \"observe that all\r\n",
      "the volcanoes are called jokuls, a word which means glacier in\r\n",
      "Icelandic, and under the high latitude of Iceland nearly all the\r\n",
      "active volcanoes discharge through beds of ice. Hence this term of\r\n",
      "jokul is applied to all the eruptive mountains in Iceland.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Follow my finger along the west coast of Iceland. Do you see\r\n",
      "Rejkiavik, the capital? You do. Well; ascend the innumerable fiords\r\n",
      "that indent those sea-beaten shores, and stop at the sixty-fifth\r\n",
      "degree of latitude. What do you see there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see a peninsula looking like a thigh bone with the knee bone at\r\n",
      "the end of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A very fair comparison, my lad. Now do you see anything upon that\r\n",
      "knee bone?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; a mountain rising out of the sea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Right. That is Snæfell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That Snæfell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is. It is a mountain five thousand feet high, one of the most\r\n",
      "remarkable in the world, if its crater leads down to the centre of\r\n",
      "the earth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that is impossible,\" I said shrugging my shoulders, and\r\n",
      "disgusted at such a ridiculous supposition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Impossible?\" said the Professor severely; \"and why, pray?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because this crater is evidently filled with lava and burning rocks,\r\n",
      "and therefore--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But suppose it is an extinct volcano?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Extinct?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is\r\n",
      "at the present time only about three hundred. But there is a very\r\n",
      "much larger number of extinct ones. Now, Snæfell is one of these.\r\n",
      "Since historic times there has been but one eruption of this\r\n",
      "mountain, that of 1219; from that time it has quieted down more and\r\n",
      "more, and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To such positive statements I could make no reply. I therefore took\r\n",
      "refuge in other dark passages of the document.\r\n",

      "\"What is the meaning of this word Scartaris, and what have the\r\n",
      "kalends of July to do with it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle took a few minutes to consider. For one short moment I felt\r\n",
      "a ray of hope, speedily to be extinguished. For he soon answered thus:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is darkness to you is light to me. This proves the ingenious\r\n",
      "care with which Saknussemm guarded and defined his discovery.\r\n",
      "Sneffels, or Snæfell, has several craters. It was therefore necessary\r\n",
      "to point out which of these leads to the centre of the globe. What\r\n",
      "did the Icelandic sage do? He observed that at the approach of the\r\n",

      "there possibly have been a more exact guide? As soon as we have\r\n",

      "the proper road to take.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "that his position on the old parchment was impregnable. I therefore\r\n",
      "ceased to press him upon that part of the subject, and as above all\r\n",
      "things he must be convinced, I passed on to scientific objections,\r\n",
      "which in my opinion were far more serious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" I said, \"I am forced to admit that Saknussemm's\r\n",
      "sentence is clear, and leaves no room for doubt. I will even allow\r\n",
      "that the document bears every mark and evidence of authenticity. That\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "of a meek disciple. \"Oh! unpleasant theories! How the theories will\r\n",
      "hinder us, won't they?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw that he was only laughing at me; but I went on all the same.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; it is perfectly well known that the internal temperature rises\r\n",
      "one degree for every 70 feet in depth; now, admitting this proportion\r\n",
      "to be constant, and the radius of the earth being fifteen hundred\r\n",
      "leagues, there must be a temperature of 360,032 degrees at the centre\r\n",
      "of the earth. Therefore, all the substances that compose the body of\r\n",
      "this earth must exist there in a state of incandescent gas; for the\r\n",
      "metals that most resist the action of heat, gold, and platinum, and\r\n",
      "the hardest rocks, can never be either solid or liquid under such a\r\n",
      "temperature. I have therefore good reason for asking if it is\r\n",
      "possible to penetrate through such a medium.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So, Axel, it is the heat that troubles you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course it is. Were we to reach a depth of thirty miles we should\r\n",
      "have arrived at the limit of the terrestrial crust, for there the\r\n",
      "temperature will be more than 2372 degrees.\"\r\n",

      "\"Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will leave you to decide that question,\" I answered rather\r\n",
      "sullenly. \"This is my decision,\" replied Professor Liedenbrock,\r\n",
      "putting on one of his grandest airs. \"Neither you nor anybody else\r\n",
      "knows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this\r\n",
      "globe, since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known;\r\n",
      "science is eminently perfectible; and every new theory is soon routed\r\n",
      "by a newer. Was it not always believed until Fourier that the\r\n",
      "temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually? and\r\n",
      "is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the\r\n",
      "ethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero Fahr.? Why\r\n",
      "should it not be the same with the internal heat? Why should it not,\r\n",
      "at a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to\r\n",
      "such a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses, of course,\r\n",
      "there was nothing to be said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I will tell you that true savants, amongst them Poisson, have\r\n",
      "demonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees [1] existed in the\r\n",
      "interior of the globe, the fiery gases arising from the fused matter\r\n",
      "would acquire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be\r\n",
      "unable to resist, and that it would explode like the plates of a\r\n",
      "bursting boiler.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is Poisson's opinion, my uncle, nothing more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Granted. But it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished\r\n",
      "geologists, that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water,\r\n",
      "nor any of the heaviest minerals known, for in none of these cases\r\n",
      "would the earth weigh what it does.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, with figures you may prove anything!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But is it the same with facts! Is it not known that the number of\r\n",
      "volcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation? and if\r\n",
      "there is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in\r\n",
      "process of diminution?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My good uncle, if you will enter into the legion of speculation, I\r\n",
      "can discuss the matter no longer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I have to tell you that the highest names have come to the\r\n",
      "support of my views. Do you remember a visit paid to me by the\r\n",
      "celebrated chemist, Humphry Davy, in 1825?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all, for I was not born until nineteen years afterwards.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Humphry Davy did call upon me on his way through Hamburg. We\r\n",
      "were long engaged in discussing, amongst other problems, the\r\n",
      "hypothesis of the liquid structure of the terrestrial nucleus. We\r\n",
      "were agreed that it could not be in a liquid state, for a reason\r\n",
      "which science has never been able to confute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[1] The degrees of temperature are given by Jules Verne according to\r\n",
      "the centigrade system, for which we will in each case substitute the\r\n",
      "Fahrenheit measurement. (Tr.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is that reason?\" I said, rather astonished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because this liquid mass would be subject, like the ocean, to the\r\n",
      "lunar attraction, and therefore twice every day there would be\r\n",
      "internal tides, which, upheaving the terrestrial crust, would cause\r\n",
      "periodical earthquakes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to\r\n",
      "the action of fire,\" I replied, \"and it is quite reasonable to\r\n",
      "suppose that the external crust cooled down first, whilst the heat\r\n",
      "took refuge down to the centre.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite a mistake,\" my uncle answered. \"The earth has been heated by\r\n",
      "combustion on its surface, that is all. Its surface was composed of a\r\n",
      "great number of metals, such as potassium and sodium, which have the\r\n",
      "peculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water;\r\n",
      "these metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon\r\n",
      "the soil; and by and by, when the waters penetrated into the fissures\r\n",
      "of the crust of the earth, they broke out into fresh combustion with\r\n",
      "explosions and eruptions. Such was the cause of the numerous\r\n",
      "volcanoes at the origin of the earth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon my word, this is a very clever hypothesis,\" I exclaimed, in\r\n",
      "spite rather of myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And which Humphry Davy demonstrated to me by a simple experiment. He\r\n",
      "formed a small ball of the metals which I have named, and which was a\r\n",
      "very fair representation of our globe; whenever he caused a fine dew\r\n",
      "of rain to fall upon its surface, it heaved up into little\r\n",
      "monticules, it became oxydized and formed miniature mountains; a\r\n",
      "crater broke open at one of its summits; the eruption took place, and\r\n",
      "communicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not\r\n",
      "be held in the hand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In truth, I was beginning to be shaken by the Professor's arguments,\r\n",
      "besides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour\r\n",
      "and fervent enthusiasm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see, Axel,\" he added, \"the condition of the terrestrial nucleus\r\n",
      "has given rise to various hypotheses among geologists; there is no\r\n",
      "proof at all for this internal heat; my opinion is that there is no\r\n",
      "such thing, it cannot be; besides we shall see for ourselves, and,\r\n",
      "like Arne Saknussemm, we shall know exactly what to hold as truth\r\n",
      "concerning this grand question.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well, we shall see,\" I replied, feeling myself carried off by\r\n",
      "his contagious enthusiasm. \"Yes, we shall see; that is, if it is\r\n",
      "possible to see anything there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why not? May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us\r\n",
      "light? May we not even expect light from the atmosphere, the pressure\r\n",
      "of which may render it luminous as we approach the centre?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" said I; \"that is possible, too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is certain,\" exclaimed my uncle in a tone of triumph. \"But\r\n",
      "silence, do you hear me? silence upon the whole subject; and let no\r\n",

      "as if there was not air enough in all the streets of Hamburg to put\r\n",

      "enthusiasm was beginning to cool down; but I felt a desire to start\r\n",
      "at once, and not to lose time and courage by calm reflection. I had\r\n",
      "at that moment quite courage enough to strap my knapsack to my\r\n",

      "handed us the key, and the ascent began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle went ahead with a light step. I followed him not without\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As long as we were protected on the inside of the winding staircase\r\n",
      "up the tower, all was well enough; but after toiling up a hundred and\r\n",
      "fifty steps the fresh air came to salute my face, and we were on the\r\n",
      "leads of the tower. There the aerial staircase began its gyrations,\r\n",
      "only guarded by a thin iron rail, and the narrowing steps seemed to\r\n",

      "cruelty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had to follow, clutching at every step. The keen air made me giddy;\r\n",
      "I felt the spire rocking with every gust of wind; my knees began to\r\n",
      "fail; soon I was crawling on my knees, then creeping on my stomach; I\r\n",
      "closed my eyes; I seemed to be lost in space.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I opened my eyes. I saw houses squashed flat as if they had all\r\n",
      "fallen down from the skies; a smoke fog seemed to drown them. Over my\r\n",
      "head ragged clouds were drifting past, and by an optical inversion\r\n",
      "they seemed stationary, while the steeple, the ball and I were all\r\n",
      "spinning along with fantastic speed. Far away on one side was the\r\n",
      "green country, on the other the sea sparkled, bathed in sunlight. The\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The _Valkyria_ was a splendid sailer, but on a sailing vessel you can\r\n",
      "place no dependence. She was taking to Rejkiavik coal, household\r\n",
      "goods, earthenware, woollen clothing, and a cargo of wheat. The crew\r\n",
      "consisted of five men, all Danes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How long will the passage take?\" my uncle asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ten days,\" the captain replied, \"if we don't meet a nor'-wester in\r\n",
      "passing the Faroes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But are you not subject to considerable delays?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, M. Liedenbrock, don't be uneasy, we shall get there in very good\r\n",
      "time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At evening the schooner doubled the Skaw at the northern point of\r\n",
      "Denmark, in the night passed the Skager Rack, skirted Norway by Cape\r\n",
      "Lindness, and entered the North Sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In two days more we sighted the coast of Scotland near Peterhead, and\r\n",
      "the _Valkyria_ turned her lead towards the Faroe Islands, passing\r\n",
      "between the Orkneys and Shetlands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon the schooner encountered the great Atlantic swell; she had to\r\n",
      "tack against the north wind, and reached the Faroes only with some\r\n",
      "difficulty. On the 8th the captain made out Myganness, the\r\n",
      "southernmost of these islands, and from that moment took a straight\r\n",
      "course for Cape Portland, the most southerly point of Iceland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The passage was marked by nothing unusual. I bore the troubles of the\r\n",
      "sea pretty well; my uncle, to his own intense disgust, and his\r\n",
      "greater shame, was ill all through the voyage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He therefore was unable to converse with the captain about Snæfell,\r\n",
      "the way to get to it, the facilities for transport, he was obliged to\r\n",
      "put off these inquiries until his arrival, and spent all his time at\r\n",
      "full length in his cabin, of which the timbers creaked and shook with\r\n",
      "every pitch she took. It must be confessed he was not undeserving of\r\n",
      "his punishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the 11th we reached Cape Portland. The clear open weather gave us\r\n",
      "a good view of Myrdals jokul, which overhangs it. The cape is merely\r\n",
      "a low hill with steep sides, standing lonely by the beach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The _Valkyria_ kept at some distance from the coast, taking a\r\n",
      "westerly course amidst great shoals of whales and sharks. Soon we\r\n",
      "came in sight of an enormous perforated rock, through which the sea\r\n",
      "dashed furiously. The Westman islets seemed to rise out of the ocean\r\n",
      "like a group of rocks in a liquid plain. From that time the schooner\r\n",
      "took a wide berth and swept at a great distance round Cape\r\n",
      "Rejkianess, which forms the western point of Iceland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rough sea prevented my uncle from coming on deck to admire these\r\n",
      "shattered and surf-beaten coasts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Forty-eight hours after, coming out of a storm which forced the\r\n",
      "schooner to scud under bare poles, we sighted east of us the beacon\r\n",
      "on Cape Skagen, where dangerous rocks extend far away seaward. An\r\n",
      "Icelandic pilot came on board, and in three hours the _Valkyria_\r\n",
      "dropped her anchor before Rejkiavik, in Faxa Bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Professor at last emerged from his cabin, rather pale and\r\n",
      "wretched-looking, but still full of enthusiasm, and with ardent\r\n",
      "satisfaction shining in his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The population of the town, wonderfully interested in the arrival of\r\n",
      "a vessel from which every one expected something, formed in groups\r\n",
      "upon the quay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle left in haste his floating prison, or rather hospital. But\r\n",
      "before quitting the deck of the schooner he dragged me forward, and\r\n",
      "pointing with outstretched finger north of the bay at a distant\r\n",
      "mountain terminating in a double peak, a pair of cones covered with\r\n",
      "perpetual snow, he cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Snæfell! Snæfell!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then recommending me, by an impressive gesture, to keep silence, he\r\n",
      "went into the boat which awaited him. I followed, and presently we\r\n",
      "were treading the soil of Iceland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first man we saw was a good-looking fellow enough, in a general's\r\n",
      "uniform. Yet he was not a general but a magistrate, the Governor of\r\n",
      "the island, M. le Baron Trampe himself. The Professor was soon aware\r\n",
      "of the presence he was in. He delivered him his letters from\r\n",
      "Copenhagen, and then followed a short conversation in the Danish\r\n",
      "language, the purport of which I was quite ignorant of, and for a\r\n",
      "very good reason. But the result of this first conversation was, that\r\n",
      "Baron Trampe placed himself entirely at the service of Professor\r\n",
      "Liedenbrock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle was just as courteously received by the mayor, M. Finsen,\r\n",
      "whose appearance was as military, and disposition and office as\r\n",
      "pacific, as the Governor's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the bishop's suffragan, M. Picturssen, he was at that moment\r\n",
      "engaged on an episcopal visitation in the north. For the time we must\r\n",
      "be resigned to wait for the honour of being presented to him. But M.\r\n",
      "Fridrikssen, professor of natural sciences at the school of\r\n",
      "Rejkiavik, was a delightful man, and his friendship became very\r\n",
      "precious to me. This modest philosopher spoke only Danish and Latin.\r\n",
      "He came to proffer me his good offices in the language of Horace, and\r\n",
      "I felt that we were made to understand each other. In fact he was the\r\n",
      "only person in Iceland with whom I could converse at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This good-natured gentleman made over to us two of the three rooms\r\n",
      "which his house contained, and we were soon installed in it with all\r\n",
      "our luggage, the abundance of which rather astonished the good people\r\n",
      "of Rejkiavik.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Axel,\" said my uncle, \"we are getting on, and now the worst is\r\n",
      "over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The worst!\" I said, astonished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To be sure, now we have nothing to do but go down.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, if that is all, you are quite right; but after all, when we have\r\n",
      "gone down, we shall have to get up again, I suppose?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh I don't trouble myself about that. Come, there's no time to lose;\r\n",
      "I am going to the library. Perhaps there is some manuscript of\r\n",
      "Saknussemm's there, and I should be glad to consult it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, while you are there I will go into the town. Won't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, that is very uninteresting to me. It is not what is upon this\r\n",
      "island, but what is underneath, that interests me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went out, and wandered wherever chance took me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would not be easy to lose your way in Rejkiavik. I was therefore\r\n",
      "under no necessity to inquire the road, which exposes one to mistakes\r\n",
      "when the only medium of intercourse is gesture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The town extends along a low and marshy level, between two hills. An\r\n",
      "immense bed of lava bounds it on one side, and falls gently towards\r\n",
      "the sea. On the other extends the vast bay of Faxa, shut in at the\r\n",
      "north by the enormous glacier of the Snæfell, and of which the\r\n",
      "_Valkyria_ was for the time the only occupant. Usually the English\r\n",
      "and French conservators of fisheries moor in this bay, but just then\r\n",
      "they were cruising about the western coasts of the island.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The longest of the only two streets that Rejkiavik possesses was\r\n",
      "parallel with the beach. Here live the merchants and traders, in\r\n",
      "wooden cabins made of red planks set horizontally; the other street,\r\n",
      "running west, ends at the little lake between the house of the bishop\r\n",
      "and other non-commercial people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had soon explored these melancholy ways; here and there I got a\r\n",
      "glimpse of faded turf, looking like a worn-out bit of carpet, or some\r\n",
      "appearance of a kitchen garden, the sparse vegetables of which\r\n",
      "(potatoes, cabbages, and lettuces), would have figured appropriately\r\n",
      "upon a Lilliputian table. A few sickly wallflowers were trying to\r\n",
      "enjoy the air and sunshine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the middle of the tin-commercial street I found the public\r\n",
      "cemetery, inclosed with a mud wall, and where there seemed plenty of\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then a few steps brought me to the Governor's house, a but compared\r\n",
      "with the town hall of Hamburg, a palace in comparison with the cabins\r\n",
      "of the Icelandic population.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Between the little lake and the town the church is built in the\r\n",
      "Protestant style, of calcined stones extracted out of the volcanoes\r\n",
      "by their own labour and at their own expense; in high westerly winds\r\n",
      "it was manifest that the red tiles of the roof would be scattered in\r\n",
      "the air, to the great danger of the faithful worshippers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a neighbouring hill I perceived the national school, where, as I\r\n",
      "was informed later by our host, were taught Hebrew, English, French,\r\n",
      "and Danish, four languages of which, with shame I confess it, I don't\r\n",
      "know a single word; after an examination I should have had to stand\r\n",
      "last of the forty scholars educated at this little college, and I\r\n",
      "should have been held unworthy to sleep along with them in one of\r\n",
      "those little double closets, where more delicate youths would have\r\n",
      "died of suffocation the very first night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In three hours I had seen not only the town but its environs. The\r\n",
      "general aspect was wonderfully dull. No trees, and scarcely any\r\n",
      "vegetation. Everywhere bare rocks, signs of volcanic action. The\r\n",
      "Icelandic huts are made of earth and turf, and the walls slope\r\n",
      "inward; they rather resemble roofs placed on the ground. But then\r\n",
      "these roofs are meadows of comparative fertility. Thanks to the\r\n",
      "internal heat, the grass grows on them to some degree of perfection.\r\n",
      "It is carefully mown in the hay season; if it were not, the horses\r\n",
      "would come to pasture on these green abodes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In my excursion I met but few people. On returning to the main street\r\n",
      "I found the greater part of the population busied in drying, salting,\r\n",
      "and putting on board codfish, their chief export. The men looked like\r\n",
      "robust but heavy, blond Germans with pensive eyes, conscious of being\r\n",
      "far removed from their fellow creatures, poor exiles relegated to\r\n",
      "this land of ice, poor creatures who should have been Esquimaux,\r\n",
      "since nature had condemned them to live only just outside the arctic\r\n",
      "circle! In vain did I try to detect a smile upon their lips;\r\n",
      "sometimes by a spasmodic and involuntary contraction of the muscles\r\n",
      "they seemed to laugh, but they never smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their costume consisted of a coarse jacket of black woollen cloth\r\n",
      "called in Scandinavian lands a 'vadmel,' a hat with a very broad\r\n",
      "brim, trousers with a narrow edge of red, and a bit of leather rolled\r\n",
      "round the foot for shoes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The women looked as sad and as resigned as the men; their faces were\r\n",
      "agreeable but expressionless, and they wore gowns and petticoats of\r\n",
      "dark 'vadmel'; as maidens, they wore over their braided hair a little\r\n",
      "knitted brown cap; when married, they put around their heads a\r\n",
      "coloured handkerchief, crowned with a peak of white linen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a good walk I returned to M. Fridrikssen's house, where I found\r\n",

      "INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WITH ICELANDIC SAVANTS\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dinner was ready. Professor Liedenbrock devoured his portion\r\n",
      "voraciously, for his compulsory fast on board had converted his\r\n",
      "stomach into a vast unfathomable gulf. There was nothing remarkable\r\n",
      "in the meal itself; but the hospitality of our host, more Danish than\r\n",
      "Icelandic, reminded me of the heroes of old. It was evident that we\r\n",
      "were more at home than he was himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation was carried on in the vernacular tongue, which my\r\n",
      "uncle mixed with German and M. Fridrikssen with Latin for my benefit.\r\n",
      "It turned upon scientific questions as befits philosophers; but\r\n",
      "Professor Liedenbrock was excessively reserved, and at every sentence\r\n",
      "spoke to me with his eyes, enjoining the most absolute silence upon\r\n",
      "our plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first place M. Fridrikssen wanted to know what success my\r\n",
      "uncle had had at the library.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your library! why there is nothing but a few tattered books upon\r\n",
      "almost deserted shelves.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" replied M. Fridrikssen, \"why we possess eight thousand\r\n",
      "volumes, many of them valuable and scarce, works in the old\r\n",
      "Scandinavian language, and we have all the novelties that Copenhagen\r\n",
      "sends us every year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where do you keep your eight thousand volumes? For my part--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, M. Liedenbrock, they are all over the country. In this icy\r\n",
      "region we are fond of study. There is not a farmer nor a fisherman\r\n",
      "that cannot read and does not read. Our principle is, that books,\r\n",
      "instead of growing mouldy behind an iron grating, should be worn out\r\n",
      "under the eyes of many readers. Therefore, these volumes are passed\r\n",
      "from one to another, read over and over, referred to again and again;\r\n",
      "and it often happens that they find their way back to their shelves\r\n",
      "only after an absence of a year or two.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And in the meantime,\" said my uncle rather spitefully, \"strangers--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what would you have? Foreigners have their libraries at home,\r\n",
      "and the first essential for labouring people is that they should be\r\n",
      "educated. I repeat to you the love of reading runs in Icelandic\r\n",
      "blood. In 1816 we founded a prosperous literary society; learned\r\n",
      "strangers think themselves honoured in becoming members of it. It\r\n",
      "publishes books which educate our fellow-countrymen, and do the\r\n",
      "country great service. If you will consent to be a corresponding\r\n",
      "member, Herr Liedenbrock, you will be giving us great pleasure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle, who had already joined about a hundred learned societies,\r\n",
      "accepted with a grace which evidently touched M. Fridrikssen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" said he, \"will you be kind enough to tell me what books you\r\n",
      "hoped to find in our library and I may perhaps enable you to consult\r\n",
      "them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle's eyes and mine met. He hesitated. This direct question went\r\n",
      "to the root of the matter. But after a moment's reflection he decided\r\n",
      "on speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Monsieur Fridrikssen, I wished to know if amongst your ancient books\r\n",
      "you possessed any of the works of Arne Saknussemm?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied the Rejkiavik professor. \"You mean that\r\n",
      "learned sixteenth century savant, a naturalist, a chemist, and a\r\n",
      "traveller?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One of the glories of Icelandic literature and science?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's the man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An illustrious man anywhere!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And whose courage was equal to his genius!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see that you know him well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle was bathed in delight at hearing his hero thus described. He\r\n",
      "feasted his eyes upon M. Fridrikssen's face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" he cried, \"where are his works?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His works, we have them not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What--not in Iceland?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They are neither in Iceland nor anywhere else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why is that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in 1573 his\r\n",
      "books were burned by the hands of the common hangman.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very good! Excellent!\" cried my uncle, to the great scandal of the\r\n",
      "professor of natural history.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!\" he cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes; now it is all clear, now it is all unravelled; and I see\r\n",
      "why Saknussemm, put into the Index Expurgatorius, and compelled to\r\n",
      "hide the discoveries made by his genius, was obliged to bury in an\r\n",
      "incomprehensible cryptogram the secret--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What secret?\" asked M. Fridrikssen, starting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, just a secret which--\" my uncle stammered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have you some private document in your possession?\" asked our host.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I was only supposing a case.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, very well,\" answered M. Fridrikssen, who was kind enough not to\r\n",
      "pursue the subject when he had noticed the embarrassment of his\r\n",
      "friend. \"I hope you will not leave our island until you have seen\r\n",
      "some of its mineralogical wealth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" replied my uncle; \"but I am rather late; or have not\r\n",
      "others been here before me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, Herr Liedenbrock; the labours of MM. Olafsen and Povelsen,\r\n",
      "pursued by order of the king, the researches of Troïl the scientific\r\n",
      "mission of MM. Gaimard and Robert on the French corvette _La\r\n",
      "Recherche,_ [1] and lately the observations of scientific men who\r\n",
      "came in the _Reine Hortense,_ have added materially to our knowledge\r\n",
      "of Iceland. But I assure you there is plenty left.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you think so?\" said my uncle, pretending to look very modest, and\r\n",
      "trying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; how many mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes there are to\r\n",
      "study, which are as yet but imperfectly known! Then, without going\r\n",
      "any further, that mountain in the horizon. That is Snæfell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said my uncle, as coolly as he was able, \"is that Snæfell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; one of the most curious volcanoes, and the crater of which has\r\n",
      "scarcely ever been visited.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it extinct?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; more than five hundred years.\"\r\n",

      "brimming over in every limb and every feature. He tried hard to put\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was conversing in the Danish language with a tall man, of robust\r\n",
      "build. This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength.\r\n",
      "His eyes, set in a large and ingenuous face, seemed to me very\r\n",
      "intelligent; they were of a dreamy sea-blue. Long hair, which would\r\n",
      "have been called red even in England, fell in long meshes upon his\r\n",
      "broad shoulders. The movements of this native were lithe and supple;\r\n",
      "but he made little use of his arms in speaking, like a man who knew\r\n",
      "nothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures. His whole\r\n",
      "appearance bespoke perfect calmness and self-possession, not\r\n",
      "indolence but tranquillity. It was felt at once that he would be\r\n",
      "beholden to nobody, that he worked for his own convenience, and that\r\n",
      "nothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic\r\n",
      "calmness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I caught the shades of this Icelander's character by the way in which\r\n",
      "he listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the\r\n",
      "Professor. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly unmoved by my\r\n",
      "uncle's incessant gesticulations. A negative was expressed by a slow\r\n",
      "movement of the head from left to right, an affirmative by a slight\r\n",
      "bend, so slight that his long hair scarcely moved. He carried economy\r\n",
      "of motion even to parsimony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly I should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he\r\n",
      "was a hunter; he did not look likely to frighten his game, nor did he\r\n",
      "seem as if he would even get near it. But the mystery was explained\r\n",
      "when M. Fridrikssen informed me that this tranquil personage was only\r\n",
      "a hunter of the eider duck, whose under plumage constitutes the chief\r\n",
      "wealth of the island. This is the celebrated eider down, and it\r\n",
      "requires no great rapidity of movement to get it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in summer the female, a very pretty bird, goes to build her\r\n",
      "nest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed.\r\n",
      "After building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her\r\n",
      "own breast. Immediately the hunter, or rather the trader, comes and\r\n",
      "robs the nest, and the female recommences her work. This goes on as\r\n",
      "long as she has any down left. When she has stripped herself bare the\r\n",
      "male takes his turn to pluck himself. But as the coarse and hard\r\n",
      "plumage of the male has no commercial value, the hunter does not take\r\n",
      "the trouble to rob the nest of this; the female therefore lays her\r\n",
      "eggs in the spoils of her mate, the young are hatched, and next year\r\n",
      "the harvest begins again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest, but\r\n",
      "rather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea, the\r\n",
      "Icelandic hunter might exercise his calling without any inconvenient\r\n",
      "exertion. He was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap\r\n",
      "his harvest, but merely to gather it in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This grave, phlegmatic, and silent individual was called Hans Bjelke;\r\n",
      "and he came recommended by M. Fridrikssen. He was our future guide.\r\n",
      "His manners were a singular contrast with my uncle's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, they soon came to understand each other. Neither looked\r\n",
      "at the amount of the payment: the one was ready to accept whatever\r\n",
      "was offered; the other was ready to give whatever was demanded. Never\r\n",
      "was bargain more readily concluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The result of the treaty was, that Hans engaged on his part to\r\n",
      "conduct us to the village of Stapi, on the south shore of the Snæfell\r\n",
      "peninsula, at the very foot of the volcano. By land this would be\r\n",
      "about twenty-two miles, to be done, said my uncle, in two days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when he learnt that the Danish mile was 24,000 feet long, he was\r\n",
      "obliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for\r\n",
      "the march.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four horses were to be placed at our disposal--two to carry him and\r\n",
      "me, two for the baggage. Hams, as was his custom, would go on foot.\r\n",
      "He knew all that part of the coast perfectly, and promised to take us\r\n",
      "the shortest way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi; he was\r\n",
      "to continue in my uncle's service for the whole period of his\r\n",
      "scientific researches, for the remuneration of three rixdales a week\r\n",
      "(about twelve shillings), but it was an express article of the\r\n",
      "covenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday\r\n",
      "at six o'clock in the evening, which, according to him, was one\r\n",
      "indispensable part of the engagement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The start was fixed for the 16th of June. My uncle wanted to pay the\r\n",
      "hunter a portion in advance, but he refused with one word:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Efter,_\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"After,\" said the Professor for my edification.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The treaty concluded, Hans silently withdrew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A famous fellow,\" cried my uncle; \"but he little thinks of the\r\n",
      "marvellous part he has to play in the future.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So he is to go with us as far as--\"\r\n",

      "\"As far as the centre of the earth, Axel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Forty-eight hours were left before our departure; to my great regret\r\n",
      "I had to employ them in preparations; for all our ingenuity was\r\n",
      "required to pack every article to the best advantage; instruments\r\n",
      "here, arms there, tools in this package, provisions in that: four\r\n",
      "sets of packages in all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The instruments were:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "1. An Eigel's centigrade thermometer, graduated up to 150 degrees\r\n",
      "(302 degrees Fahr.), which seemed to me too much or too little. Too\r\n",
      "much if the internal heat was to rise so high, for in this case we\r\n",
      "should be baked, not enough to measure the temperature of springs or\r\n",
      "any matter in a state of fusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. An aneroid barometer, to indicate extreme pressures of the\r\n",
      "atmosphere. An ordinary barometer would not have answered the\r\n",
      "purpose, as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point\r\n",
      "which the mercurial barometer [1] would not register.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. A chronometer, made by Boissonnas, jun., of Geneva, accurately set\r\n",
      "to the meridian of Hamburg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. Two compasses, viz., a common compass and a dipping needle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5. A night glass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "6. Two of Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which, by means of an electric\r\n",
      "current, supplied a safe and handy portable light [2]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The arms consisted of two of Purdy's rifles and two brace of pistols.\r\n",
      "But what did we want arms for? We had neither savages nor wild beasts\r\n",
      "to fear, I supposed. But my uncle seemed to believe in his arsenal as\r\n",
      "in his instruments, and more especially in a considerable quantity of\r\n",
      "gun cotton, which is unaffected by moisture, and the explosive force\r\n",
      "of which exceeds that of gunpowder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[1] In M. Verne's book a 'manometer' is the instrument used, of which\r\n",
      "very little is known. In a complete list of philosophical instruments\r\n",
      "the translator cannot find the name. As he is assured by a first-rate\r\n",
      "instrument maker, Chadburn, of Liverpool, that an aneroid can be\r\n",
      "constructed to measure any depth, he has thought it best to furnish\r\n",
      "the adventurous professor with this more familiar instrument. The\r\n",
      "'manometer' is generally known as a pressure gauge.--TRANS.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[2] Ruhmkorff's apparatus consists of a Bunsen pile worked with\r\n",
      "bichromate of potash, which makes no smell; an induction coil carries\r\n",
      "the electricity generated by the pile into communication with a\r\n",
      "lantern of peculiar construction; in this lantern there is a spiral\r\n",
      "glass tube from which the air has been excluded, and in which remains\r\n",
      "only a residuum of carbonic acid gas or of nitrogen. When the\r\n",
      "apparatus is put in action this gas becomes luminous, producing a\r\n",
      "white steady light. The pile and coil are placed in a leathern bag\r\n",
      "which the traveller carries over his shoulders; the lantern outside\r\n",
      "of the bag throws sufficient light into deep darkness; it enables one\r\n",
      "to venture without fear of explosions into the midst of the most\r\n",
      "inflammable gases, and is not extinguished even in the deepest\r\n",
      "waters. M. Ruhmkorff is a learned and most ingenious man of science;\r\n",
      "his great discovery is his induction coil, which produces a powerful\r\n",
      "stream of electricity. He obtained in 1864 the quinquennial prize of\r\n",
      "50,000 franc reserved by the French government for the most ingenious\r\n",
      "application of electricity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tools comprised two pickaxes, two spades, a silk ropeladder,\r\n",
      "three iron-tipped sticks, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges and\r\n",
      "iron spikes, and a long knotted rope. Now this was a large load, for\r\n",
      "the ladder was 300 feet long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there were provisions too: this was not a large parcel, but it\r\n",
      "was comforting to know that of essence of beef and biscuits there\r\n",
      "were six months' consumption. Spirits were the only liquid, and of\r\n",
      "water we took none; but we had flasks, and my uncle depended on\r\n",
      "springs from which to fill them. Whatever objections I hazarded as to\r\n",
      "their quality, temperature, and even absence, remained ineffectual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To complete the exact inventory of all our travelling accompaniments,\r\n",
      "I must not forget a pocket medicine chest, containing blunt scissors,\r\n",
      "splints for broken limbs, a piece of tape of unbleached linen,\r\n",
      "bandages and compresses, lint, a lancet for bleeding, all dreadful\r\n",
      "articles to take with one. Then there was a row of phials containing\r\n",
      "dextrine, alcoholic ether, liquid acetate of lead, vinegar, and\r\n",
      "ammonia drugs which afforded me no comfort. Finally, all the articles\r\n",
      "needful to supply Ruhmkorff's apparatus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle did not forget a supply of tobacco, coarse grained powder,\r\n",
      "and amadou, nor a leathern belt in which he carried a sufficient\r\n",
      "quantity of gold, silver, and paper money. Six pairs of boots and\r\n",
      "shoes, made waterproof with a composition of indiarubber and naphtha,\r\n",
      "were packed amongst the tools.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Clothed, shod, and equipped like this,\" said my uncle, \"there is no\r\n",
      "telling how far we may go.\"\r\n",

      "Dr. Hyaltalin, the first medical man of the place, being of the\r\n",
      "party. M. Fridrikssen was not there. I learned afterwards that he and\r\n",
      "the Governor disagreed upon some question of administration, and did\r\n",
      "not speak to each other. I therefore knew not a single word of all\r\n",
      "that was said at this semi-official dinner; but I could not help\r\n",
      "noticing that my uncle talked the whole time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the 15th our preparations were all made. Our host gave the\r\n",
      "Professor very great pleasure by presenting him with a map of Iceland\r\n",
      "far more complete than that of Hendersen. It was the map of M. Olaf\r\n",
      "Nikolas Olsen, in the proportion of 1 to 480,000 of the actual size\r\n",
      "of the island, and published by the Icelandic Literary Society. It\r\n",
      "was a precious document for a mineralogist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our last evening was spent in intimate conversation with M.\r\n",
      "Fridrikssen, with whom I felt the liveliest sympathy; then, after the\r\n",
      "talk, succeeded, for me, at any rate, a disturbed and restless night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At five in the morning I was awoke by the neighing and pawing of four\r\n",
      "horses under my window. I dressed hastily and came down into the\r\n",
      "street. Hans was finishing our packing, almost as it were without\r\n",
      "moving a limb; and yet he did his work cleverly. My uncle made more\r\n",
      "noise than execution, and the guide seemed to pay very little\r\n",
      "attention to his energetic directions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At six o'clock our preparations were over. M. Fridrikssen shook hands\r\n",
      "with us. My uncle thanked him heartily for his extreme kindness. I\r\n",
      "constructed a few fine Latin sentences to express my cordial\r\n",
      "farewell. Then we bestrode our steeds and with his last adieu M.\r\n",
      "Fridrikssen treated me to a line of Virgil eminently applicable to\r\n",

      "We had started under a sky overcast but calm. There was no fear of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The pleasure of riding on horseback over an unknown country made me\r\n",
      "easy to be pleased at our first start. I threw myself wholly into the\r\n",
      "pleasure of the trip, and enjoyed the feeling of freedom and\r\n",
      "satisfied desire. I was beginning to take a real share in the\r\n",
      "enterprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Besides,\" I said to myself, \"where's the risk? Here we are\r\n",

      "climb a very remarkable mountain; at the worst we are going to\r\n",
      "scramble down an extinct crater. It is evident that Saknussemm did\r\n",

      "This reasoning having settled my mind, we got out of Rejkiavik.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans moved steadily on, keeping ahead of us at an even, smooth, and\r\n",
      "rapid pace. The baggage horses followed him without giving any\r\n",

      "pastures which were trying very hard, but in vain, to look green;\r\n",
      "yellow came out best. The rugged peaks of the trachyte rocks\r\n",
      "presented faint outlines on the eastern horizon; at times a few\r\n",
      "patches of snow, concentrating the vague light, glittered upon the\r\n",
      "slopes of the distant mountains; certain peaks, boldly uprising,\r\n",

      "mists, like breakers emerging in the heavens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Often these chains of barren rocks made a dip towards the sea, and\r\n",
      "encroached upon the scanty pasturage: but there was always enough\r\n",
      "room to pass. Besides, our horses instinctively chose the easiest\r\n",
      "places without ever slackening their pace. My uncle was refused even\r\n",
      "the satisfaction of stirring up his beast with whip or voice. He had\r\n",
      "no excuse for being impatient. I could not help smiling to see so\r\n",
      "tall a man on so small a pony, and as his long legs nearly touched\r\n",
      "the ground he looked like a six-legged centaur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good horse! good horse!\" he kept saying. \"You will see, Axel, that\r\n",
      "there is no more sagacious animal than the Icelandic horse. He is\r\n",
      "stopped by neither snow, nor storm, nor impassable roads, nor rocks,\r\n",
      "glaciers, or anything. He is courageous, sober, and surefooted. He\r\n",
      "never makes a false step, never shies. If there is a river or fiord\r\n",
      "to cross (and we shall meet with many) you will see him plunge in at\r\n",
      "once, just as if he were amphibious, and gain the opposite bank. But\r\n",
      "we must not hurry him; we must let him have his way, and we shall get\r\n",
      "on at the rate of thirty miles a day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We may; but how about our guide?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, never mind him. People like him get over the ground without a\r\n",
      "thought. There is so little action in this man that he will never get\r\n",
      "tired; and besides, if he wants it, he shall have my horse. I shall\r\n",
      "get cramped if I don't have a little action. The arms are all right,\r\n",
      "but the legs want exercise.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were advancing at a rapid pace. The country was already almost a\r\n",
      "desert. Here and there was a lonely farm, called a boër built either\r\n",
      "of wood, or of sods, or of pieces of lava, looking like a poor beggar\r\n",
      "by the wayside. These ruinous huts seemed to solicit charity from\r\n",
      "passers-by; and on very small provocation we should have given alms\r\n",
      "for the relief of the poor inmates. In this country there were no\r\n",
      "roads and paths, and the poor vegetation, however slow, would soon\r\n",
      "efface the rare travellers' footsteps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet this part of the province, at a very small distance from the\r\n",
      "capital, is reckoned among the inhabited and cultivated portions of\r\n",
      "Iceland. What, then, must other tracts be, more desert than this\r\n",
      "desert? In the first half mile we had not seen one farmer standing\r\n",
      "before his cabin door, nor one shepherd tending a flock less wild\r\n",
      "than himself, nothing but a few cows and sheep left to themselves.\r\n",
      "What then would be those convulsed regions upon which we were\r\n",
      "advancing, regions subject to the dire phenomena of eruptions, the\r\n",
      "offspring of volcanic explosions and subterranean convulsions?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were to know them before long, but on consulting Olsen's map, I\r\n",
      "saw that they would be avoided by winding along the seashore. In\r\n",
      "fact, the great plutonic action is confined to the central portion of\r\n",
      "the island; there, rocks of the trappean and volcanic class,\r\n",
      "including trachyte, basalt, and tuffs and agglomerates associated\r\n",
      "with streams of lava, have made this a land of supernatural horrors.\r\n",
      "I had no idea of the spectacle which was awaiting us in the peninsula\r\n",
      "of Snæfell, where these ruins of a fiery nature have formed a\r\n",
      "frightful chaos.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In two hours from Rejkiavik we arrived at the burgh of Gufunes,\r\n",
      "called Aolkirkja, or principal church. There was nothing remarkable\r\n",
      "here but a few houses, scarcely enough for a German hamlet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans stopped here half an hour. He shared with us our frugal\r\n",
      "breakfast; answering my uncle's questions about the road and our\r\n",
      "resting place that night with merely yes or no, except when he said\r\n",
      "\"Gardär.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I consulted the map to see where Gardär was. I saw there was a small\r\n",
      "town of that name on the banks of the Hvalfiord, four miles from\r\n",
      "Rejkiavik. I showed it to my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four miles only!\" he exclaimed; \"four miles out of twenty-eight.\r\n",
      "What a nice little walk!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was about to make an observation to the guide, who without\r\n",
      "answering resumed his place at the head, and went on his way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three hours later, still treading on the colourless grass of the\r\n",
      "pasture land, we had to work round the Kolla fiord, a longer way but\r\n",
      "an easier one than across that inlet. We soon entered into a\r\n",
      "'pingstaoer' or parish called Ejulberg, from whose steeple twelve\r\n",
      "o'clock would have struck, if Icelandic churches were rich enough to\r\n",
      "possess clocks. But they are like the parishioners who have no\r\n",
      "watches and do without.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There our horses were baited; then taking the narrow path to left\r\n",
      "between a chain of hills and the sea, they carried us to our next\r\n",
      "stage, the aolkirkja of Brantär and one mile farther on, to Saurboër\r\n",
      "'Annexia,' a chapel of ease built on the south shore of the Hvalfiord.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now four o'clock, and we had gone four Icelandic miles, or\r\n",
      "twenty-four English miles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In that place the fiord was at least three English miles wide; the\r\n",
      "waves rolled with a rushing din upon the sharp-pointed rocks; this\r\n",
      "inlet was confined between walls of rock, precipices crowned by sharp\r\n",
      "peaks 2,000 feet high, and remarkable for the brown strata which\r\n",
      "separated the beds of reddish tuff. However much I might respect the\r\n",
      "intelligence of our quadrupeds, I hardly cared to put it to the test\r\n",
      "by trusting myself to it on horseback across an arm of the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If they are as intelligent as they are said to be, I thought, they\r\n",
      "won't try it. In any case, I will tax my intelligence to direct\r\n",
      "theirs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But my uncle would not wait. He spurred on to the edge. His steed\r\n",
      "lowered his head to examine the nearest waves and stopped. My uncle,\r\n",
      "who had an instinct of his own, too, applied pressure, and was again\r\n",
      "refused by the animal significantly shaking his head. Then followed\r\n",
      "strong language, and the whip; but the brute answered these arguments\r\n",
      "with kicks and endeavours to throw his rider. At last the clever\r\n",
      "little pony, with a bend of his knees, started from under the\r\n",
      "Professor's legs, and left him standing upon two boulders on the\r\n",
      "shore just like the colossus of Rhodes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Confounded brute!\" cried the unhorsed horseman, suddenly degraded\r\n",
      "into a pedestrian, just as ashamed as a cavalry officer degraded to a\r\n",
      "foot soldier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Färja,_\" said the guide, touching his shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! a boat?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Der,_\" replied Hans, pointing to one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I cried; \"there is a boat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why did not you say so then? Well, let us go on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Tidvatten,_\" said the guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is he saying?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says tide,\" said my uncle, translating the Danish word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No doubt we must wait for the tide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Förbida,_\" said my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Ja,_\" replied Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle stamped with his foot, while the horses went on to the boat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I perfectly understood the necessity of abiding a particular moment\r\n",
      "of the tide to undertake the crossing of the fiord, when, the sea\r\n",
      "having reached its greatest height, it should be slack water. Then\r\n",
      "the ebb and flow have no sensible effect, and the boat does not risk\r\n",
      "being carried either to the bottom or out to sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That favourable moment arrived only with six o'clock; when my uncle,\r\n",
      "myself, the guide, two other passengers and the four horses, trusted\r\n",
      "ourselves to a somewhat fragile raft. Accustomed as I was to the\r\n",
      "swift and sure steamers on the Elbe, I found the oars of the rowers\r\n",
      "rather a slow means of propulsion. It took us more than an hour to\r\n",
      "cross the fiord; but the passage was effected without any mishap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another half hour we had reached the aolkirkja of Gardär\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "HOSPITALITY UNDER THE ARCTIC CIRCLE\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It ought to have been night-time, but under the 65th parallel there\r\n",
      "was nothing surprising in the nocturnal polar light. In Iceland\r\n",
      "during the months of June and July the sun does not set.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the temperature was much lower. I was cold and more hungry than\r\n",
      "cold. Welcome was the sight of the boër which was hospitably opened\r\n",
      "to receive us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a peasant's house, but in point of hospitality it was equal to\r\n",
      "a king's. On our arrival the master came with outstretched hands, and\r\n",
      "without more ceremony he beckoned us to follow him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To accompany him down the long, narrow, dark passage, would have been\r\n",
      "impossible. Therefore, we followed, as he bid us. The building was\r\n",
      "constructed of roughly squared timbers, with rooms on both sides,\r\n",
      "four in number, all opening out into the one passage: these were the\r\n",
      "kitchen, the weaving shop, the badstofa, or family sleeping-room, and\r\n",
      "the visitors' room, which was the best of all. My uncle, whose height\r\n",
      "had not been thought of in building the house, of course hit his head\r\n",
      "several times against the beams that projected from the ceilings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were introduced into our apartment, a large room with a floor of\r\n",
      "earth stamped hard down, and lighted by a window, the panes of which\r\n",
      "were formed of sheep's bladder, not admitting too much light. The\r\n",
      "sleeping accommodation consisted of dry litter, thrown into two\r\n",
      "wooden frames painted red, and ornamented with Icelandic sentences. I\r\n",
      "was hardly expecting so much comfort; the only discomfort proceeded\r\n",
      "from the strong odour of dried fish, hung meat, and sour milk, of\r\n",
      "which my nose made bitter complaints.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was\r\n",
      "heard inviting us to the kitchen, the only room where a fire was\r\n",
      "lighted even in the severest cold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle lost no time in obeying the friendly call, nor was I slack\r\n",
      "in following.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kitchen chimney was constructed on the ancient pattern; in the\r\n",
      "middle of the room was a stone for a hearth, over it in the roof a\r\n",
      "hole to let the smoke escape. The kitchen was also a dining-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At our entrance the host, as if he had never seen us, greeted us with\r\n",
      "the word \"_Sællvertu,_\" which means \"be happy,\" and came and kissed\r\n",
      "us on the cheek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After him his wife pronounced the same words, accompanied with the\r\n",
      "same ceremonial; then the two placing their hands upon their hearts,\r\n",
      "inclined profoundly before us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hasten to inform the reader that this Icelandic lady was the mother\r\n",
      "of nineteen children, all, big and little, swarming in the midst of\r\n",
      "the dense wreaths of smoke with which the fire on the hearth filled\r\n",
      "the chamber. Every moment I noticed a fair-haired and rather\r\n",
      "melancholy face peeping out of the rolling volumes of smoke--they\r\n",
      "were a perfect cluster of unwashed angels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle and I treated this little tribe with kindness; and in a very\r\n",
      "short time we each had three or four of these brats on our shoulders,\r\n",
      "as many on our laps, and the rest between our knees. Those who could\r\n",
      "speak kept repeating \"_Sællvertu,_\" in every conceivable tone; those\r\n",
      "that could not speak made up for that want by shrill cries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This concert was brought to a close by the announcement of dinner. At\r\n",
      "that moment our hunter returned, who had been seeing his horses\r\n",
      "provided for; that is to say, he had economically let them loose in\r\n",
      "the fields, where the poor beasts had to content themselves with the\r\n",
      "scanty moss they could pull off the rocks and a few meagre sea weeds,\r\n",
      "and the next day they would not fail to come of themselves and resume\r\n",
      "the labours of the previous day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Sællvertu,_\" said Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then calmly, automatically, and dispassionately he kissed the host,\r\n",
      "the hostess, and their nineteen children.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This ceremony over, we sat at table, twenty-four in number, and\r\n",
      "therefore one upon another. The luckiest had only two urchins upon\r\n",
      "their knees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But silence reigned in all this little world at the arrival of the\r\n",
      "soup, and the national taciturnity resumed its empire even over the\r\n",
      "children. The host served out to us a soup made of lichen and by no\r\n",
      "means unpleasant, then an immense piece of dried fish floating in\r\n",
      "butter rancid with twenty years' keeping, and, therefore, according\r\n",
      "to Icelandic gastronomy, much preferable to fresh butter. Along with\r\n",
      "this, we had 'skye,' a sort of clotted milk, with biscuits, and a\r\n",
      "liquid prepared from juniper berries; for beverage we had a thin milk\r\n",
      "mixed with water, called in this country 'blanda.' It is not for me\r\n",
      "to decide whether this diet is wholesome or not; all I can say is,\r\n",
      "that I was desperately hungry, and that at dessert I swallowed to the\r\n",
      "very last gulp of a thick broth made from buckwheat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as the meal was over the children disappeared, and their\r\n",
      "elders gathered round the peat fire, which also burnt such\r\n",
      "miscellaneous fuel as briars, cow-dung, and fishbones. After this\r\n",
      "little pinch of warmth the different groups retired to their\r\n",
      "respective rooms. Our hostess hospitably offered us her assistance in\r\n",
      "undressing, according to Icelandic usage; but on our gracefully\r\n",
      "declining, she insisted no longer, and I was able at last to curl\r\n",
      "myself up in my mossy bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At five next morning we bade our host farewell, my uncle with\r\n",
      "difficulty persuading him to accept a proper remuneration; and Hans\r\n",
      "signalled the start.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At a hundred yards from Gardär the soil began to change its aspect;\r\n",
      "it became boggy and less favourable to progress. On our right the\r\n",
      "chain of mountains was indefinitely prolonged like an immense system\r\n",
      "of natural fortifications, of which we were following the\r\n",
      "counter-scarp or lesser steep; often we were met by streams, which we\r\n",
      "had to ford with great care, not to wet our packages.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The desert became wider and more hideous; yet from time to time we\r\n",
      "seemed to descry a human figure that fled at our approach, sometimes\r\n",
      "a sharp turn would bring us suddenly within a short distance of one\r\n",
      "of these spectres, and I was filled with loathing at the sight of a\r\n",
      "huge deformed head, the skin shining and hairless, and repulsive\r\n",
      "sores visible through the gaps in the poor creature's wretched rags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The unhappy being forbore to approach us and offer his misshapen\r\n",
      "hand. He fled away, but not before Hans had saluted him with the\r\n",
      "customary \"_Sællvertu._\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Spetelsk,_\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A leper!\" my uncle repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This word produced a repulsive effect. The horrible disease of\r\n",
      "leprosy is too common in Iceland; it is not contagious, but\r\n",
      "hereditary, and lepers are forbidden to marry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These apparitions were not cheerful, and did not throw any charm over\r\n",
      "the less and less attractive landscapes. The last tufts of grass had\r\n",
      "disappeared from beneath our feet. Not a tree was to be seen, unless\r\n",
      "we except a few dwarf birches as low as brushwood. Not an animal but\r\n",
      "a few wandering ponies that their owners would not feed. Sometimes we\r\n",
      "could see a hawk balancing himself on his wings under the grey cloud,\r\n",
      "and then darting away south with rapid flight. I felt melancholy\r\n",
      "under this savage aspect of nature, and my thoughts went away to the\r\n",
      "cheerful scenes I had left in the far south.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had to cross a few narrow fiords, and at last quite a wide gulf;\r\n",
      "the tide, then high, allowed us to pass over without delay, and to\r\n",
      "reach the hamlet of Alftanes, one mile beyond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening, after having forded two rivers full of trout and pike,\r\n",
      "called Alfa and Heta, we were obliged to spend the night in a\r\n",
      "deserted building worthy to be haunted by all the elfins of\r\n",
      "Scandinavia. The ice king certainly held court here, and gave us all\r\n",
      "night long samples of what he could do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No particular event marked the next day. Bogs, dead levels,\r\n",
      "melancholy desert tracks, wherever we travelled. By nightfall we had\r\n",
      "accomplished half our journey, and we lay at Krösolbt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the 19th of June, for about a mile, that is an Icelandic mile, we\r\n",
      "walked upon hardened lava; this ground is called in the country\r\n",
      "'hraun'; the writhen surface presented the appearance of distorted,\r\n",
      "twisted cables, sometimes stretched in length, sometimes contorted\r\n",
      "together; an immense torrent, once liquid, now solid, ran from the\r\n",
      "nearest mountains, now extinct volcanoes, but the ruins around\r\n",
      "revealed the violence of the past eruptions. Yet here and there were\r\n",
      "a few jets of steam from hot springs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had no time to watch these phenomena; we had to proceed on our\r\n",
      "way. Soon at the foot of the mountains the boggy land reappeared,\r\n",
      "intersected by little lakes. Our route now lay westward; we had\r\n",
      "turned the great bay of Faxa, and the twin peaks of Snæfell rose\r\n",
      "white into the cloudy sky at the distance of at least five miles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The horses did their duty well, no difficulties stopped them in their\r\n",
      "steady career. I was getting tired; but my uncle was as firm and\r\n",
      "straight as he was at our first start. I could not help admiring his\r\n",
      "persistency, as well as the hunter's, who treated our expedition like\r\n",
      "a mere promenade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "June 20. At six p.m. we reached Büdir, a village on the sea shore;\r\n",
      "and the guide there claiming his due, my uncle settled with him. It\r\n",
      "was Hans' own family, that is, his uncles and cousins, who gave us\r\n",
      "hospitality; we were kindly received, and without taxing too much the\r\n",
      "goodness of these folks, I would willingly have tarried here to\r\n",
      "recruit after my fatigues. But my uncle, who wanted no recruiting,\r\n",
      "would not hear of it, and the next morning we had to bestride our\r\n",
      "beasts again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Basalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The wall that confined the fiord, like all the coast of the\r\n",
      "peninsula, was composed of a series of vertical columns thirty feet\r\n",
      "high. These straight shafts, of fair proportions, supported an\r\n",

      "formed a semi-arch over the sea. At intervals, under this natural\r\n",
      "shelter, there spread out vaulted entrances in beautiful curves, into\r\n",
      "which the waves came dashing with foam and spray. A few shafts of\r\n",
      "basalt, torn from their hold by the fury of tempests, lay along the\r\n",
      "soil like remains of an ancient temple, in ruins for ever fresh, and\r\n",
      "over which centuries passed without leaving a trace of age upon them.\r\n",

      "position of things; when the latter, suspending his labours for a\r\n",
      "moment, uttered a sound no doubt understood between horses and\r\n",
      "farriers, and immediately a tall and ugly hag appeared from the hut.\r\n",
      "She must have been six feet at the least. I was in great alarm lest\r\n",
      "she should treat me to the Icelandic kiss; but there was no occasion\r\n",
      "to fear, nor did she do the honours at all too gracefully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitors' room seemed to me the worst in the whole cabin. It was\r\n",
      "close, dirty, and evil smelling. But we had to be content. The rector\r\n",
      "did not to go in for antique hospitality. Very far from it. Before\r\n",
      "the day was over I saw that we had to do with a blacksmith, a\r\n",
      "fisherman, a hunter, a joiner, but not at all with a minister of the\r\n",
      "Gospel. To be sure, it was a week-day; perhaps on a Sunday he made\r\n",
      "amends.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't mean to say anything against these poor priests, who after\r\n",
      "all are very wretched. They receive from the Danish Government a\r\n",
      "ridiculously small pittance, and they get from the parish the fourth\r\n",
      "part of the tithe, which does not come to sixty marks a year (about\r\n",
      "£4). Hence the necessity to work for their livelihood; but after\r\n",
      "fishing, hunting, and shoeing horses for any length of time, one soon\r\n",
      "gets into the ways and manners of fishermen, hunters, and farriers,\r\n",
      "and other rather rude and uncultivated people; and that evening I\r\n",
      "found out that temperance was not among the virtues that\r\n",
      "distinguished my host.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle soon discovered what sort of a man he had to do with;\r\n",
      "instead of a good and learned man he found a rude and coarse peasant.\r\n",
      "He therefore resolved to commence the grand expedition at once, and\r\n",
      "to leave this inhospitable parsonage. He cared nothing about fatigue,\r\n",
      "and resolved to spend some days upon the mountain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day\r\n",
      "after our arrival at Stapi. Hans hired the services of three\r\n",
      "Icelanders to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the\r\n",
      "burdens; but as soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives\r\n",
      "were to turn back and leave us to our own devices. This was to be\r\n",
      "clearly understood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle now took the opportunity to explain to Hans that it was his\r\n",
      "intention to explore the interior of the volcano to its farthest\r\n",
      "limits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans merely nodded. There or elsewhere, down in the bowels of the\r\n",
      "earth, or anywhere on the surface, all was alike to him. For my own\r\n",
      "part the incidents of the journey had hitherto kept me amused, and\r\n",
      "made me forgetful of coming evils; but now my fears again were\r\n",
      "beginning to get the better of me. But what could I do? The place to\r\n",
      "resist the Professor would have been Hamburg, not the foot of Snæfell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One thought, above all others, harassed and alarmed me; it was one\r\n",
      "calculated to shake firmer nerves than mine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, thought I, here we are, about to climb Snæfell. Very good. We\r\n",
      "will explore the crater. Very good, too, others have done as much\r\n",
      "without dying for it. But that is not all. If there is a way to\r\n",
      "penetrate into the very bowels of the island, if that ill-advised\r\n",
      "Saknussemm has told a true tale, we shall lose our way amidst the\r\n",
      "deep subterranean passages of this volcano. Now, there is no proof\r\n",
      "that Snæfell is extinct. Who can assure us that an eruption is not\r\n",
      "brewing at this very moment? Does it follow that because the monster\r\n",
      "has slept since 1229 he must therefore never awake again? And if he\r\n",
      "wakes up presently, where shall we be?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was worth while debating this question, and I did debate it. I\r\n",
      "could not sleep for dreaming about eruptions. Now, the part of\r\n",
      "ejected scoriae and ashes seemed to my mind a very rough one to act.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, at last, when I could hold out no longer, I resolved to lay the\r\n",
      "case before my uncle, as prudently and as cautiously as possible,\r\n",
      "just under the form of an almost impossible hypothesis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went to him. I communicated my fears to him, and drew back a step\r\n",
      "to give him room for the explosion which I knew must follow. But I\r\n",
      "was mistaken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was thinking of that,\" he replied with great simplicity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What could those words mean?--Was he actually going to listen to\r\n",
      "reason? Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans? This was\r\n",
      "too good to be true.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a few moments' silence, during which I dared not question him,\r\n",
      "he resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was thinking of that. Ever since we arrived at Stapi I have been\r\n",
      "occupied with the important question you have just opened, for we\r\n",
      "must not be guilty of imprudence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\" I replied with forcible emphasis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For six hundred years Snæfell has been dumb; but he may speak again.\r\n",
      "Now, eruptions are always preceded by certain well-known phenomena. I\r\n",
      "have therefore examined the natives, I have studied external\r\n",
      "appearances, and I can assure you, Axel, that there will be no\r\n",
      "eruption.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this positive affirmation I stood amazed and speechless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't doubt my word?\" said my uncle. \"Well, follow me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I obeyed like an automaton. Coming out from the priest's house, the\r\n",
      "Professor took a straight road, which, through an opening in the\r\n",
      "basaltic wall, led away from the sea. We were soon in the open\r\n",
      "country, if one may give that name to a vast extent of mounds of\r\n",
      "volcanic products. This tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous\r\n",
      "ejected rocks of trap, basalt, granite, and all kinds of igneous\r\n",
      "rocks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here and there I could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into\r\n",
      "the air, called in Icelandic 'reykir,' issuing from thermal springs,\r\n",
      "and indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath. This\r\n",
      "seemed to justify my fears: But I fell from the height of my new-born\r\n",
      "hopes when my uncle said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see all these volumes of steam, Axel; well, they demonstrate\r\n",
      "that we have nothing to fear from the fury of a volcanic eruption.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Am I to believe that?\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Understand this clearly,\" added the Professor. \"At the approach of\r\n",
      "an eruption these jets would redouble their activity, but disappear\r\n",
      "altogether during the period of the eruption. For the elastic fluids,\r\n",
      "being no longer under pressure, go off by way of the crater instead\r\n",
      "of escaping by their usual passages through the fissures in the soil.\r\n",
      "Therefore, if these vapours remain in their usual condition, if they\r\n",
      "display no augmentation of force, and if you add to this the\r\n",
      "observation that the wind and rain are not ceasing and being replaced\r\n",
      "by a still and heavy atmosphere, then you may affirm that no eruption\r\n",
      "is preparing.\"\r\n",

      "\"But--\"\r\n",

      "babblers hold their peace.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I returned to the parsonage, very crestfallen. My uncle had beaten me\r\n",
      "with the weapons of science. Still I had one hope left, and this was,\r\n",
      "that when we had reached the bottom of the crater it would be\r\n",
      "impossible, for want of a passage, to go deeper, in spite of all the\r\n",
      "Saknussemm's in Iceland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I spent that whole night in one constant nightmare; in the heart of a\r\n",
      "volcano, and from the deepest depths of the earth I saw myself tossed\r\n",
      "up amongst the interplanetary spaces under the form of an eruptive\r\n",
      "rock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day, June 23, Hans was awaiting us with his companions\r\n",
      "carrying provisions, tools, and instruments; two iron pointed sticks,\r\n",
      "two rifles, and two shot belts were for my uncle and myself. Hans, as\r\n",
      "a cautious man, had added to our luggage a leathern bottle full of\r\n",

      "water for eight days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was nine in the morning. The priest and his tall Megæra were\r\n",
      "awaiting us at the door. We supposed they were standing there to bid\r\n",
      "us a kind farewell. But the farewell was put in the unexpected form\r\n",
      "of a heavy bill, in which everything was charged, even to the very\r\n",
      "air we breathed in the pastoral house, infected as it was. This\r\n",
      "worthy couple were fleecing us just as a Swiss innkeeper might have\r\n",
      "done, and estimated their imperfect hospitality at the highest price.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle paid without a remark: a man who is starting for the centre\r\n",
      "of the earth need not be particular about a few rix dollars.\r\n",

      "trachytic belt which stands out distinctly in the mountain system of\r\n",
      "the island. From our starting point we could see the two peaks boldly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "After we had passed the basaltic wall of the fiord of Stapi we passed\r\n",
      "over a vegetable fibrous peat bog, left from the ancient vegetation\r\n",
      "of this peninsula. The vast quantity of this unworked fuel would be\r\n",
      "sufficient to warm the whole population of Iceland for a century;\r\n",

      "depth of seventy feet, and presented layers of carbonized remains of\r\n",
      "vegetation alternating with thinner layers of tufaceous pumice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a true nephew of the Professor Liedenbrock, and in spite of my\r\n",
      "dismal prospects, I could not help observing with interest the\r\n",
      "mineralogical curiosities which lay about me as in a vast museum, and\r\n",
      "I constructed for myself a complete geological account of Iceland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This most curious island has evidently been projected from the bottom\r\n",
      "of the sea at a comparatively recent date. Possibly, it may still be\r\n",
      "subject to gradual elevation. If this is the case, its origin may\r\n",
      "well be attributed to subterranean fires. Therefore, in this case,\r\n",
      "the theory of Sir Humphry Davy, Saknussemm's document, and my uncle's\r\n",
      "theories would all go off in smoke. This hypothesis led me to examine\r\n",
      "with more attention the appearance of the surface, and I soon arrived\r\n",
      "at a conclusion as to the nature of the forces which presided at its\r\n",
      "birth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Iceland, which is entirely devoid of alluvial soil, is wholly\r\n",
      "composed of volcanic tufa, that is to say, an agglomeration of porous\r\n",
      "rocks and stones. Before the volcanoes broke out it consisted of trap\r\n",
      "rocks slowly upraised to the level of the sea by the action of\r\n",
      "central forces. The internal fires had not yet forced their way\r\n",
      "through.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at a later period a wide chasm formed diagonally from south-west\r\n",
      "to north-east, through which was gradually forced out the trachyte\r\n",
      "which was to form a mountain chain. No violence accompanied this\r\n",
      "change; the matter thrown out was in vast quantities, and the liquid\r\n",
      "material oozing out from the abysses of the earth slowly spread in\r\n",
      "extensive plains or in hillocky masses. To this period belong the\r\n",
      "felspar, syenites, and porphyries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But with the help of this outflow the thickness of the crust of the\r\n",
      "island increased materially, and therefore also its powers of\r\n",
      "resistance. It may easily be conceived what vast quantities of\r\n",
      "elastic gases, what masses of molten matter accumulated beneath its\r\n",
      "solid surface whilst no exit was practicable after the cooling of the\r\n",
      "trachytic crust. Therefore a time would come when the elastic and\r\n",
      "explosive forces of the imprisoned gases would upheave this ponderous\r\n",
      "cover and drive out for themselves openings through tall chimneys.\r\n",
      "Hence then the volcano would distend and lift up the crust, and then\r\n",
      "burst through a crater suddenly formed at the summit or thinnest part\r\n",
      "of the volcano.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the eruption succeeded other volcanic phenomena. Through the\r\n",
      "outlets now made first escaped the ejected basalt of which the plain\r\n",
      "we had just left presented such marvellous specimens. We were moving\r\n",
      "over grey rocks of dense and massive formation, which in cooling had\r\n",
      "formed into hexagonal prisms. Everywhere around us we saw truncated\r\n",
      "cones, formerly so many fiery mouths.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the exhaustion of the basalt, the volcano, the power of which\r\n",
      "grew by the extinction of the lesser craters, supplied an egress to\r\n",
      "lava, ashes, and scoriae, of which I could see lengthened screes\r\n",
      "streaming down the sides of the mountain like flowing hair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was the succession of phenomena which produced Iceland, all\r\n",
      "arising from the action of internal fire; and to suppose that the\r\n",
      "mass within did not still exist in a state of liquid incandescence\r\n",
      "was absurd; and nothing could surpass the absurdity of fancying that\r\n",
      "it was possible to reach the earth's centre.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I felt a little comforted as we advanced to the assault of Snæfell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The way was growing more and more arduous, the ascent steeper and\r\n",
      "steeper; the loose fragments of rock trembled beneath us, and the\r\n",
      "utmost care was needed to avoid dangerous falls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans went on as quietly as if he were on level ground; sometimes he\r\n",
      "disappeared altogether behind the huge blocks, then a shrill whistle\r\n",
      "would direct us on our way to him. Sometimes he would halt, pick up a\r\n",
      "few bits of stone, build them up into a recognisable form, and thus\r\n",
      "made landmarks to guide us in our way back. A very wise precaution in\r\n",
      "itself, but, as things turned out, quite useless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three hours' fatiguing march had only brought us to the base of the\r\n",
      "mountain. There Hans bid us come to a halt, and a hasty breakfast was\r\n",
      "served out. My uncle swallowed two mouthfuls at a time to get on\r\n",
      "faster. But, whether he liked it or not, this was a rest as well as a\r\n",
      "breakfast hour and he had to wait till it pleased our guide to move\r\n",
      "on, which came to pass in an hour. The three Icelanders, just as\r\n",
      "taciturn as their comrade the hunter, never spoke, and ate their\r\n",

      "close to us, and yet how many weary hours it took to reach it! The\r\n",
      "stones, adhering by no soil or fibrous roots of vegetation, rolled\r\n",
      "away from under our feet, and rushed down the precipice below with\r\n",
      "the swiftness of an avalanche.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At some places the flanks of the mountain formed an angle with the\r\n",

      "lost sight of me, and in many straits his arm furnished me with a\r\n",
      "powerful support. He himself seemed to possess an instinct for\r\n",
      "equilibrium, for he never stumbled. The Icelanders, though burdened\r\n",
      "with our loads, climbed with the agility of mountaineers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To judge by the distant appearance of the summit of Snæfell, it would\r\n",
      "have seemed too steep to ascend on our side. Fortunately, after an\r\n",
      "hour of fatigue and athletic exercises, in the midst of the vast\r\n",
      "surface of snow presented by the hollow between the two peaks, a kind\r\n",
      "of staircase appeared unexpectedly which greatly facilitated our\r\n",
      "ascent. It was formed by one of those torrents of stones flung up by\r\n",
      "the eruptions, called 'sting' by the Icelanders. If this torrent had\r\n",
      "not been arrested in its fall by the formation of the sides of the\r\n",
      "mountain, it would have gone on to the sea and formed more islands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such as it was, it did us good service. The steepness increased, but\r\n",
      "these stone steps allowed us to rise with facility, and even with\r\n",
      "such rapidity that, having rested for a moment while my companions\r\n",
      "continued their ascent, I perceived them already reduced by distance\r\n",
      "to microscopic dimensions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At seven we had ascended the two thousand steps of this grand\r\n",
      "staircase, and we had attained a bulge in the mountain, a kind of bed\r\n",
      "on which rested the cone proper of the crater.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three thousand two hundred feet below us stretched the sea. We had\r\n",
      "passed the limit of perpetual snow, which, on account of the moisture\r\n",
      "of the climate, is at a greater elevation in Iceland than the high\r\n",
      "latitude would give reason to suppose. The cold was excessively keen.\r\n",
      "The wind was blowing violently. I was exhausted. The Professor saw\r\n",
      "that my limbs were refusing to perform their office, and in spite of\r\n",
      "his impatience he decided on stopping. He therefore spoke to the\r\n",
      "hunter, who shook his head, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Ofvanför._\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It seems we must go higher,\" said my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he asked Hans for his reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Mistour,_\" replied the guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Ja Mistour,_\" said one of the Icelanders in a tone of alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does that word mean?\" I asked uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look!\" said my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked down upon the plain. An immense column of pulverized pumice,\r\n",
      "sand and dust was rising with a whirling circular motion like a\r\n",
      "waterspout; the wind was lashing it on to that side of Snæfell where\r\n",
      "we were holding on; this dense veil, hung across the sun, threw a\r\n",
      "deep shadow over the mountain. If that huge revolving pillar sloped\r\n",
      "down, it would involve us in its whirling eddies. This phenomenon,\r\n",
      "which is not unfrequent when the wind blows from the glaciers, is\r\n",
      "called in Icelandic 'mistour.'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Hastigt! hastigt!_\" cried our guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without knowing Danish I understood at once that we must follow Hans\r\n",
      "at the top of our speed. He began to circle round the cone of the\r\n",
      "crater, but in a diagonal direction so as to facilitate our progress.\r\n",
      "Presently the dust storm fell upon the mountain, which quivered under\r\n",
      "the shock; the loose stones, caught with the irresistible blasts of\r\n",
      "wind, flew about in a perfect hail as in an eruption. Happily we were\r\n",
      "on the opposite side, and sheltered from all harm. But for the\r\n",
      "precaution of our guide, our mangled bodies, torn and pounded into\r\n",
      "fragments, would have been carried afar like the ruins hurled along\r\n",
      "by some unknown meteor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet Hans did not think it prudent to spend the night upon the sides\r\n",
      "of the cone. We continued our zigzag climb. The fifteen hundred\r\n",
      "remaining feet took us five hours to clear; the circuitous route, the\r\n",
      "diagonal and the counter marches, must have measured at least three\r\n",
      "leagues. I could stand it no longer. I was yielding to the effects of\r\n",
      "hunger and cold. The rarefied air scarcely gave play to the action of\r\n",
      "my lungs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, at eleven in the sunlight night, the summit of Snæfell was\r\n",
      "reached, and before going in for shelter into the crater I had time\r\n",
      "to observe the midnight sun, at his lowest point, gilding with his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Supper was rapidly devoured, and the little company housed themselves\r\n",
      "as best they could. The bed was hard, the shelter not very\r\n",
      "substantial, and our position an anxious one, at five thousand feet\r\n",
      "above the sea level. Yet I slept particularly well; it was one of the\r\n",
      "best nights I had ever had, and I did not even dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next morning we awoke half frozen by the sharp keen air, but with the\r\n",
      "light of a splendid sun. I rose from my granite bed and went out to\r\n",
      "enjoy the magnificent spectacle that lay unrolled before me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stood on the very summit of the southernmost of Snæfell's peaks.\r\n",
      "The range of the eye extended over the whole island. By an optical\r\n",
      "law which obtains at all great heights, the shores seemed raised and\r\n",
      "the centre depressed. It seemed as if one of Helbesmer's raised maps\r\n",
      "lay at my feet. I could see deep valleys intersecting each other in\r\n",
      "every direction, precipices like low walls, lakes reduced to ponds,\r\n",
      "rivers abbreviated into streams. On my right were numberless glaciers\r\n",
      "and innumerable peaks, some plumed with feathery clouds of smoke. The\r\n",
      "undulating surface of these endless mountains, crested with sheets of\r\n",
      "snow, reminded one of a stormy sea. If I looked westward, there the\r\n",
      "ocean lay spread out in all its magnificence, like a mere\r\n",
      "continuation of those flock-like summits. The eye could hardly tell\r\n",
      "where the snowy ridges ended and the foaming waves began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was thus steeped in the marvellous ecstasy which all high summits\r\n",
      "develop in the mind; and now without giddiness, for I was beginning\r\n",
      "to be accustomed to these sublime aspects of nature. My dazzled eyes\r\n",
      "were bathed in the bright flood of the solar rays. I was forgetting\r\n",
      "where and who I was, to live the life of elves and sylphs, the\r\n",
      "fanciful creation of Scandinavian superstitions. I felt intoxicated\r\n",
      "with the sublime pleasure of lofty elevations without thinking of the\r\n",
      "profound abysses into which I was shortly to be plunged. But I was\r\n",
      "brought back to the realities of things by the arrival of Hans and\r\n",
      "the Professor, who joined me on the summit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle pointed out to me in the far west a light steam or mist, a\r\n",
      "semblance of land, which bounded the distant horizon of waters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Greenland!\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Greenland?\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; we are only thirty-five leagues from it; and during thaws the\r\n",
      "white bears, borne by the ice fields from the north, are carried even\r\n",
      "into Iceland. But never mind that. Here we are at the top of Snæfell\r\n",
      "and here are two peaks, one north and one south. Hans will tell us\r\n",
      "the name of that on which we are now standing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question being put, Hans replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Scartaris.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle shot a triumphant glance at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now for the crater!\" he cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crater of Snæfell resembled an inverted cone, the opening of which\r\n",
      "might be half a league in diameter. Its depth appeared to be about\r\n",
      "two thousand feet. Imagine the aspect of such a reservoir, brim full\r\n",
      "and running over with liquid fire amid the rolling thunder. The\r\n",
      "bottom of the funnel was about 250 feet in circuit, so that the\r\n",
      "gentle slope allowed its lower brim to be reached without much\r\n",
      "difficulty. Involuntarily I compared the whole crater to an enormous\r\n",
      "erected mortar, and the comparison put me in a terrible fright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What madness,\" I thought, \"to go down into a mortar, perhaps a\r\n",
      "loaded mortar, to be shot up into the air at a moment's notice!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I did not try to back out of it. Hans with perfect coolness\r\n",
      "resumed the lead, and I followed him without a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In order to facilitate the descent, Hans wound his way down the cone\r\n",
      "by a spiral path. Our route lay amidst eruptive rocks, some of which,\r\n",
      "shaken out of their loosened beds, rushed bounding down the abyss,\r\n",
      "and in their fall awoke echoes remarkable for their loud and\r\n",
      "well-defined sharpness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In certain parts of the cone there were glaciers. Here Hans advanced\r\n",
      "only with extreme precaution, sounding his way with his iron-pointed\r\n",
      "pole, to discover any crevasses in it. At particularly dubious\r\n",
      "passages we were obliged to connect ourselves with each other by a\r\n",
      "long cord, in order that any man who missed his footing might be held\r\n",
      "up by his companions. This solid formation was prudent, but did not\r\n",
      "remove all danger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet, notwithstanding the difficulties of the descent, down steeps\r\n",
      "unknown to the guide, the journey was accomplished without accidents,\r\n",
      "except the loss of a coil of rope, which escaped from the hands of an\r\n",
      "Icelander, and took the shortest way to the bottom of the abyss.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At mid-day we arrived. I raised my head and saw straight above me the\r\n",
      "upper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small\r\n",
      "circumference, but almost perfectly round. Just upon the edge\r\n",
      "appeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear\r\n",
      "against endless space.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the bottom of the crater were three chimneys, through which, in\r\n",
      "its eruptions, Snæfell had driven forth fire and lava from its\r\n",
      "central furnace. Each of these chimneys was a hundred feet in\r\n",
      "diameter. They gaped before us right in our path. I had not the\r\n",
      "courage to look down either of them. But Professor Liedenbrock had\r\n",
      "hastily surveyed all three; he was panting, running from one to the\r\n",
      "other, gesticulating, and uttering incoherent expressions. Hans and\r\n",
      "his comrades, seated upon loose lava rocks, looked at him with as much\r\n",
      "wonder as they knew how to express, and perhaps taking him for an\r\n",
      "escaped lunatic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly my uncle uttered a cry. I thought his foot must have slipped\r\n",
      "and that he had fallen down one of the holes. But, no; I saw him,\r\n",
      "with arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart, erect before a\r\n",
      "granite rock that stood in the centre of the crater, just like a\r\n",
      "pedestal made ready to receive a statue of Pluto. He stood like a man\r\n",
      "stupefied, but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Axel, Axel,\" he cried. \"Come, come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ran. Hans and the Icelanders never stirred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look!\" cried the Professor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, sharing his astonishment, but I think not his joy, I read on the\r\n",
      "western face of the block, in Runic characters, half mouldered away\r\n",
      "with lapse of ages, this thrice-accursed name:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[At this point a Runic text appears]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied my uncle. \"Do you yet doubt?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made no answer; and I returned in silence to my lava seat in a\r\n",
      "state of utter speechless consternation. Here was crushing evidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How long I remained plunged in agonizing reflections I cannot tell;\r\n",
      "all that I know is, that on raising my head again, I saw only my\r\n",
      "uncle and Hans at the bottom of the crater. The Icelanders had been\r\n",
      "dismissed, and they were now descending the outer slopes of Snæfell\r\n",
      "to return to Stapi.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans slept peaceably at the foot of a rock, in a lava bed, where he\r\n",
      "had found a suitable couch for himself; but my uncle was pacing\r\n",
      "around the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had\r\n",
      "neither the wish nor the strength to rise, and following the guide's\r\n",
      "example I went off into an unhappy slumber, fancying I could hear\r\n",
      "ominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus the first night in the crater passed away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next morning, a grey, heavy, cloudy sky seemed to droop over the\r\n",
      "summit of the cone. I did not know this first from the appearances of\r\n",
      "nature, but I found it out by my uncle's impetuous wrath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I soon found out the cause, and hope dawned again in my heart. For\r\n",
      "this reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of the three ways open before us, one had been taken by Saknussemm.\r\n",
      "The indications of the learned Icelander hinted at in the cryptogram,\r\n",
      "pointed to this fact that the shadow of Scartaris came to touch that\r\n",
      "particular way during the latter days of the month of June.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That sharp peak might hence be considered as the gnomon of a vast sun\r\n",
      "dial, the shadow projected from which on a certain day would point\r\n",
      "out the road to the centre of the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, no sun no shadow, and therefore no guide. Here was June 25. If\r\n",
      "the sun was clouded for six days we must postpone our visit till next\r\n",
      "year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My limited powers of description would fail, were I to attempt a\r\n",
      "picture of the Professor's angry impatience. The day wore on, and no\r\n",
      "shadow came to lay itself along the bottom of the crater. Hans did\r\n",
      "not move from the spot he had selected; yet he must be asking himself\r\n",
      "what were we waiting for, if he asked himself anything at all. My\r\n",
      "uncle spoke not a word to me. His gaze, ever directed upwards, was\r\n",
      "lost in the grey and misty space beyond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the 26th nothing yet. Rain mingled with snow was falling all day\r\n",
      "long. Hans built a hut of pieces of lava. I felt a malicious pleasure\r\n",
      "in watching the thousand rills and cascades that came tumbling down\r\n",
      "the sides of the cone, and the deafening continuous din awaked by\r\n",
      "every stone against which they bounded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle's rage knew no bounds. It was enough to irritate a meeker\r\n",
      "man than he; for it was foundering almost within the port.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Heaven never sends unmixed grief, and for Professor Liedenbrock\r\n",
      "there was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate\r\n",
      "anxieties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day the sky was again overcast; but on the 29th of June, the\r\n",
      "last day but one of the month, with the change of the moon came a\r\n",
      "change of weather. The sun poured a flood of light down the crater.\r\n",
      "Every hillock, every rock and stone, every projecting surface, had\r\n",
      "its share of the beaming torrent, and threw its shadow on the ground.\r\n",
      "Amongst them all, Scartaris laid down his sharp-pointed angular\r\n",
      "shadow which began to move slowly in the opposite direction to that\r\n",
      "of the radiant orb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle turned too, and followed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At noon, being at its least extent, it came and softly fell upon the\r\n",
      "edge of the middle chimney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There it is! there it is!\" shouted the Professor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now for the centre of the globe!\" he added in Danish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked at Hans, to hear what he would say.\r\n",

      "\"_Forüt!_\" was his tranquil answer.\r\n",

      "Now began our real journey. Hitherto our toil had overcome all\r\n",
      "difficulties, now difficulties would spring up at every step.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had not yet ventured to look down the bottomless pit into which I\r\n",
      "was about to take a plunge. The supreme hour had come. I might now\r\n",
      "either share in the enterprise or refuse to move forward. But I was\r\n",
      "ashamed to recoil in the presence of the hunter. Hans accepted the\r\n",
      "enterprise with such calmness, such indifference, such perfect\r\n",
      "disregard of any possible danger that I blushed at the idea of being\r\n",
      "less brave than he. If I had been alone I might have once more tried\r\n",
      "the effect of argument; but in the presence of the guide I held my\r\n",
      "peace; my heart flew back to my sweet Virlandaise, and I approached\r\n",
      "the central chimney.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have already mentioned that it was a hundred feet in diameter, and\r\n",
      "three hundred feet round. I bent over a projecting rock and gazed\r\n",
      "down. My hair stood on end with terror. The bewildering feeling of\r\n",
      "vacuity laid hold upon me. I felt my centre of gravity shifting its\r\n",
      "place, and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness. There\r\n",
      "is nothing more treacherous than this attraction down deep abysses. I\r\n",
      "was just about to drop down, when a hand laid hold of me. It was that\r\n",
      "of Hans. I suppose I had not taken as many lessons on gulf\r\n",
      "exploration as I ought to have done in the Frelsers Kirk at\r\n",
      "Copenhagen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, however short was my examination of this well, I had taken some\r\n",
      "account of its conformation. Its almost perpendicular walls were\r\n",
      "bristling with innumerable projections which would facilitate the\r\n",
      "descent. But if there was no want of steps, still there was no rail.\r\n",
      "A rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us\r\n",
      "down. But how were we to unfasten it, when arrived at the other end?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle employed a very simple expedient to obviate this difficulty.\r\n",
      "He uncoiled a cord of the thickness of a finger, and four hundred\r\n",
      "feet long; first he dropped half of it down, then he passed it round\r\n",
      "a lava block that projected conveniently, and threw the other half\r\n",
      "down the chimney. Each of us could then descend by holding with the\r\n",
      "hand both halves of the rope, which would not be able to unroll\r\n",
      "itself from its hold; when two hundred feet down, it would be easy to\r\n",
      "get possession of the whole of the rope by letting one end go and\r\n",
      "pulling down by the other. Then the exercise would go on again _ad\r\n",
      "infinitum_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" said my uncle, after having completed these preparations, \"now\r\n",
      "let us look to our loads. I will divide them into three lots; each of\r\n",
      "us will strap one upon his back. I mean only fragile articles.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, we were not included under that head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hans,\" said he, \"will take charge of the tools and a portion of the\r\n",

      "My uncle was always willing to employ magnificent resources. Obeying\r\n",
      "orders, Hans tied all the non-fragile articles in one bundle, corded\r\n",
      "them firmly, and sent them bodily down the gulf before us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I listened to the dull thuds of the descending bale. My uncle,\r\n",
      "leaning over the abyss, followed the descent of the luggage with a\r\n",
      "satisfied nod, and only rose erect when he had quite lost sight of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well, now it is our turn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now I ask any sensible man if it was possible to hear those words\r\n",
      "without a shudder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Professor fastened his package of instruments upon his shoulders;\r\n",
      "Hans took the tools; I took the arms: and the descent commenced in\r\n",
      "the following order; Hans, my uncle, and myself. It was effected in\r\n",
      "profound silence, broken only by the descent of loosened stones down\r\n",
      "the dark gulf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I dropped as it were, frantically clutching the double cord with one\r\n",
      "hand and buttressing myself from the wall with the other by means of\r\n",
      "my stick. One idea overpowered me almost, fear lest the rock should\r\n",
      "give way from which I was hanging. This cord seemed a fragile thing\r\n",
      "for three persons to be suspended from. I made as little use of it as\r\n",
      "possible, performing wonderful feats of equilibrium upon the lava\r\n",
      "projections which my foot seemed to catch hold of like a hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When one of these slippery steps shook under the heavier form of\r\n",
      "Hans, he said in his tranquil voice:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Attention!\" repeated my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock jammed in\r\n",
      "across the chimney from one side to the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans pulled the rope by one of its ends, the other rose in the air;\r\n",
      "after passing the higher rock it came down again, bringing with it a\r\n",
      "rather dangerous shower of bits of stone and lava.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground, I observed that\r\n",
      "the bottom of the hole was still invisible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same manoeuvre was repeated with the cord, and half an hour after\r\n",
      "we had descended another two hundred feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I don't suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would\r\n",
      "have studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing. I am sure\r\n",
      "I did trouble my head about them. Pliocene, miocene, eocene,\r\n",
      "cretaceous, jurassic, triassic, permian, carboniferous, devonian,\r\n",
      "silurian, or primitive was all one to me. But the Professor, no\r\n",
      "doubt, was pursuing his observations or taking notes, for in one of\r\n",
      "our halts he said to me:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The farther I go the more confidence I feel. The order of these\r\n",
      "volcanic formations affords the strongest confirmation to the\r\n",
      "theories of Davy. We are now among the primitive rocks, upon which\r\n",
      "the chemical operations took place which are produced by the contact\r\n",
      "of elementary bases of metals with water. I repudiate the notion of\r\n",
      "central heat altogether. We shall see further proof of that very\r\n",
      "soon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No variation, always the same conclusion. Of course, I was not\r\n",
      "inclined to argue. My silence was taken for consent and the descent\r\n",
      "went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another three hours, and I saw no bottom to the chimney yet. When I\r\n",
      "lifted my head I perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture.\r\n",
      "Its walls, by a gentle incline, were drawing closer to each other,\r\n",
      "and it was beginning to grow darker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still we kept descending. It seemed to me that the falling stones\r\n",
      "were meeting with an earlier resistance, and that the concussion gave\r\n",
      "a more abrupt and deadened sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I had taken care to keep an exact account of our manoeuvres with\r\n",
      "the rope, which I knew that we had repeated fourteen times, each\r\n",
      "descent occupying half an hour, the conclusion was easy that we had\r\n",
      "been seven hours, plus fourteen quarters of rest, making ten hours\r\n",
      "and a half. We had started at one, it must therefore now be eleven\r\n",
      "o'clock; and the depth to which we had descended was fourteen times\r\n",
      "200 feet, or 2,800 feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment I heard the voice of Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Halt!\" he cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stopped short just as I was going to place my feet upon my uncle's\r\n",

      "\"Is there no way farther?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; there is a sort of passage which inclines to the right. We will\r\n",
      "see about that to-morrow. Let us have our supper, and go to sleep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The darkness was not yet complete. The provision case was opened; we\r\n",
      "refreshed ourselves, and went to sleep as well as we could upon a bed\r\n",
      "of stones and lava fragments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When lying on my back, I opened my eyes and saw a bright sparkling\r\n",

      "now a vast telescope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a star which, seen from this depth, had lost all\r\n",

      "At eight in the morning a ray of daylight came to wake us up. The\r\n",

      "passage, and scattered it like a shower of sparks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was light enough to distinguish surrounding objects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Axel, what do you say to it?\" cried my uncle, rubbing his\r\n",
      "hands. \"Did you ever spend a quieter night in our little house at\r\n",
      "Königsberg? No noise of cart wheels, no cries of basket women, no\r\n",
      "boatmen shouting!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No doubt it is very quiet at the bottom of this well, but there is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Now come!\" my uncle cried; \"if you are frightened already, what will\r\n",
      "you be by and by? We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels\r\n",
      "of the earth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I mean that we have only reached the level of the island, long\r\n",
      "vertical tube, which terminates at the mouth of the crater, has its\r\n",
      "lower end only at the level of the sea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you sure of that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite sure. Consult the barometer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, the mercury, which had risen in the instrument as fast as we\r\n",
      "descended, had stopped at twenty-nine inches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see,\" said the Professor, \"we have now only the pressure of our\r\n",
      "atmosphere, and I shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of\r\n",
      "the barometer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the\r\n",
      "weight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at\r\n",
      "the level of the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" I said, \"is there not reason to fear that this ever-increasing\r\n",
      "pressure will become at last very painful to bear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; we shall descend at a slow rate, and our lungs will become\r\n",
      "inured to a denser atmosphere. Aeronauts find the want of air as they\r\n",
      "rise to high elevations, but we shall perhaps have too much: of the\r\n",
      "two, this is what I should prefer. Don't let us lose a moment. Where\r\n",
      "is the bundle we sent down before us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening\r\n",
      "before. My uncle questioned Hans, who, after having examined\r\n",
      "attentively with the eye of a huntsman, replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Der huppe!_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Up there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so it was. The bundle had been caught by a projection a hundred\r\n",
      "feet above us. Immediately the Icelander climbed up like a cat, and\r\n",
      "in a few minutes the package was in our possession.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast; but we must lay in a good\r\n",
      "stock, for we don't know how long we may have to go on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The biscuit and extract of meat were washed down with a draught of\r\n",
      "water mingled with a little gin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Breakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook,\r\n",
      "intended for scientific observations. He consulted his instruments,\r\n",
      "and recorded:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Monday, July 1.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Chronometer, 8.17 a.m.; barometer, 297 in.; thermometer, 6° (43°\r\n",
      "F.). Direction, E.S.E.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated\r\n",
      "by the compass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, Axel,\" cried the Professor with enthusiasm, \"now we are really\r\n",
      "going into the interior of the earth. At this precise moment the\r\n",
      "journey commences.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So saying, my uncle took in one hand Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which was\r\n",
      "hanging from his neck; and with the other he formed an electric\r\n",
      "communication with the coil in the lantern, and a sufficiently bright\r\n",
      "light dispersed the darkness of the passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans carried the other apparatus, which was also put into action.\r\n",
      "This ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on\r\n",
      "for a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of\r\n",
      "the most inflammable gases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, march!\" cried my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Each shouldered his package. Hans drove before him the load of cords\r\n",
      "and clothes; and, myself walking last, we entered the gallery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery, I raised my\r\n",
      "head, and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube\r\n",
      "the sky of Iceland, which I was never to behold again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lava, in the last eruption of 1229, had forced a passage through\r\n",
      "this tunnel. It still lined the walls with a thick and glistening\r\n",
      "coat. The electric light was here intensified a hundredfold by\r\n",
      "reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only difficulty in proceeding lay in not sliding too fast down an\r\n",
      "incline of about forty-five degrees; happily certain asperities and a\r\n",
      "few blisterings here and there formed steps, and we descended,\r\n",
      "letting our baggage slip before us from the end of a long rope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that which formed steps under our feet became stalactites\r\n",
      "overhead. The lava, which was porous in many places, had formed a\r\n",
      "surface covered with small rounded blisters; crystals of opaque\r\n",
      "quartz, set with limpid tears of glass, and hanging like clustered\r\n",
      "chandeliers from the vaulted roof, seemed as it were to kindle and\r\n",
      "form a sudden illumination as we passed on our way. It seemed as if\r\n",
      "the genii of the depths were lighting up their palace to receive\r\n",
      "their terrestrial guests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is magnificent!\" I cried spontaneously. \"My uncle, what a sight!\r\n",
      "Don't you admire those blending hues of lava, passing from reddish\r\n",
      "brown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades? And these crystals\r\n",
      "are just like globes of light.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ali, you think so, do you, Axel, my boy? Well, you will see greater\r\n",
      "splendours than these, I hope. Now let us march: march!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had better have said slide, for we did nothing but drop down the\r\n",
      "steep inclines. It was the facifs _descensus Averni_ of Virgil. The\r\n",
      "compass, which I consulted frequently, gave our direction as\r\n",
      "south-east with inflexible steadiness. This lava stream deviated\r\n",
      "neither to the right nor to the left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet there was no sensible increase of temperature. This justified\r\n",
      "Davy's theory, and more than once I consulted the thermometer with\r\n",
      "surprise. Two hours after our departure it only marked 10° (50°\r\n",
      "Fahr.), an increase of only 4°. This gave reason for believing that\r\n",
      "our descent was more horizontal than vertical. As for the exact depth\r\n",
      "reached, it was very easy to ascertain that; the Professor measured\r\n",
      "accurately the angles of deviation and inclination on the road, but\r\n",
      "he kept the results to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About eight in the evening he signalled to stop. Hans sat down at\r\n",
      "once. The lamps were hung upon a projection in the lava; we were in a\r\n",
      "sort of cavern where there was plenty of air. Certain puffs of air\r\n",
      "reached us. What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them? I\r\n",
      "could not answer that question at the moment. Hunger and fatigue made\r\n",
      "me incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven hours consecutively is\r\n",
      "not made without considerable expenditure of strength. I was\r\n",
      "exhausted. The order to 'halt' therefore gave me pleasure. Hans laid\r\n",
      "our provisions upon a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite.\r\n",
      "But one thing troubled me, our supply of water was half consumed. My\r\n",
      "uncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources, but\r\n",
      "hitherto we had met with none. I could not help drawing his attention\r\n",
      "to this circumstance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you surprised at this want of springs?\" he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More than that, I am anxious about it; we have only water enough for\r\n",
      "five days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be uneasy, Axel, we shall find more than we want.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When we have left this bed of lava behind us. How could springs\r\n",
      "break through such walls as these?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth. It seems to me\r\n",
      "that we have made no great progress vertically.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you suppose that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because if we had gone deep into the crust of earth, we should have\r\n",
      "encountered greater heat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"According to your system,\" said my uncle. \"But what does the\r\n",
      "thermometer say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hardly fifteen degrees (59° Fahr), nine degrees only since our\r\n",
      "departure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what is your conclusion?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is my conclusion. According to exact observations, the increase\r\n",
      "of temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of\r\n",
      "one degree (1 4/5° Fahr.) for every hundred feet. But certain local\r\n",
      "conditions may modify this rate. Thus at Yakoutsk in Siberia the\r\n",
      "increase of a degree is ascertained to be reached every 36 feet. This\r\n",
      "difference depends upon the heat-conducting power of the rocks.\r\n",
      "Moreover, in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano, through gneiss,\r\n",
      "it has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained\r\n",
      "at every 125 feet. Let us therefore assume this last hypothesis as\r\n",
      "the most suitable to our situation, and calculate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, do calculate, my boy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing is easier,\" said I, putting down figures in my note book.\r\n",
      "\"Nine times a hundred and twenty-five feet gives a depth of eleven\r\n",
      "hundred and twenty-five feet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very accurate indeed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By my observation we are at 10,000 feet below the level of the sea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that possible?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, or figures are of no use.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Professor's calculations were quite correct. We had already\r\n",
      "attained a depth of six thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by\r\n",
      "the foot of man, such as the mines of Kitz Bahl in Tyrol, and those\r\n",
      "of Wuttembourg in Bohemia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The temperature, which ought to have been 81° (178° Fahr.) was\r\n",

      "which an ancient people gave its name to this system. Specimens of\r\n",
      "magnificent marbles clothed the walls, some of a greyish agate\r\n",
      "fantastically veined with white, others of rich crimson or yellow\r\n",

      "The greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms.\r\n",
      "Creation had evidently advanced since the day before. Instead of\r\n",
      "rudimentary trilobites, I noticed remains of a more perfect order of\r\n",
      "beings, amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in\r\n",
      "which palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms.\r\n",
      "The Devonian seas were peopled by animals of these species, and\r\n",

      "It was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in\r\n",

      "After ten hours' walking I observed a singular deadening of the\r\n",
      "reflection of our lamps from the side walls. The marble, the schist,\r\n",
      "the limestone, and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On Saturday, at six, we started afresh. In twenty minutes we reached\r\n",
      "a vast open space; I then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed\r\n",
      "out this mine; the vaults would have been shored up, and, as it was,\r\n",
      "they seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in\r\n",
      "height. A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean\r\n",
      "disturbance. Yielding to some vast power from below it had broken\r\n",

      "The whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these\r\n",
      "gloomy walls, and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At the age of the world which preceded the secondary period, the\r\n",
      "earth was clothed with immense vegetable forms, the product of the\r\n",

      "Thence arises the conclusion that the high temperature then existing\r\n",
      "was due to some other source than the heat of the sun. Perhaps even\r\n",
      "the orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part\r\n",
      "he now acts. There were no 'climates' as yet, and a torrid heat,\r\n",
      "equal from pole to equator, was spread over the whole surface of the\r\n",
      "globe. Whence this heat? Was it from the interior of the earth?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Notwithstanding the theories of Professor Liedenbrock, a violent heat\r\n",
      "did at that time brood within the body of the spheroid. Its action\r\n",
      "was felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust; the plants,\r\n",
      "unacquainted with the beneficent influences of the sun, yielded\r\n",
      "neither flowers nor scent. But their roots drew vigorous life from\r\n",
      "the burning soil of the early days of this planet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were but few trees. Herbaceous plants alone existed. There were\r\n",
      "tall grasses, ferns, lycopods, besides sigillaria, asterophyllites,\r\n",
      "now scarce plants, but then the species might be counted by thousands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse\r\n",
      "vegetation. The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed\r\n",
      "the fluid forces beneath. Thence innumerable fissures and\r\n",
      "depressions. The plants, sunk underneath the waters, formed by\r\n",
      "degrees into vast accumulated masses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then came the chemical action of nature; in the depths of the seas\r\n",
      "the vegetable accumulations first became peat; then, acted upon by\r\n",
      "generated gases and the heat of fermentation, they underwent a\r\n",
      "process of complete mineralization.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus were formed those immense coalfields, which nevertheless, are\r\n",
      "not inexhaustible, and which three centuries at the present\r\n",

      "odour of protocarburet of hydrogen. I immediately recognised in this\r\n",

      "against excessive fatigue and the tortures of thirst.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, on Tuesday, July 8, we arrived on our hands and knees, and\r\n",
      "half dead, at the junction of the two roads. There I dropped like a\r\n",
      "lifeless lump, extended on the lava soil. It was ten in the morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans and my uncle, clinging to the wall, tried to nibble a few bits\r\n",
      "of biscuit. Long moans escaped from my swollen lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After some time my uncle approached me and raised me in his arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor boy!\" said he, in genuine tones of compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was touched with these words, not being accustomed to see the\r\n",
      "excitable Professor in a softened mood. I grasped his trembling hands\r\n",
      "in mine. He let me hold them and looked at me. His eyes were\r\n",
      "moistened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I saw him take the flask that was hanging at his side. To my\r\n",
      "amazement he placed it on my lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Drink!\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had I heard him? Was my uncle beside himself? I stared at, him\r\n",
      "stupidly, and felt as if I could not understand him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Drink!\" he said again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And raising his flask he emptied it every drop between my lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh! infinite pleasure! a slender sip of water came to moisten my\r\n",
      "burning mouth. It was but one sip but it was enough to recall my\r\n",
      "ebbing life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thanked my uncle with clasped hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, \"a draught of water; but it is the very last--you\r\n",
      "hear!--the last. I had kept it as a precious treasure at the bottom\r\n",
      "of my flask. Twenty times, nay, a hundred times, have I fought\r\n",
      "against a frightful impulse to drink it off. But no, Axel, I kept it\r\n",
      "for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear uncle,\" I said, whilst hot tears trickled down my face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that as soon as you arrived at these cross\r\n",
      "roads you would drop half dead, and I kept my last drop of water to\r\n",
      "reanimate you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, thank you,\" I said. Although my thirst was only partially\r\n",
      "quenched, yet some strength had returned. The muscles of my throat,\r\n",
      "until then contracted, now relaxed again; and the inflammation of my\r\n",
      "lips abated somewhat; and I was now able to speak. .\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us see,\" I said, \"we have now but one thing to do. We have no\r\n",
      "water; we must go back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I spoke my uncle avoided looking at me; he hung his head down;\r\n",
      "his eyes avoided mine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We must return,\" I exclaimed vehemently; \"we must go back on our way\r\n",
      "to Snæfell. May God give us strength to climb up the crater again!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Return!\" said my uncle, as if he was rather answering himself than\r\n",
      "me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, return, without the loss of a minute.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A long silence followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So then, Axel,\" replied the Professor ironically, \"you have found no\r\n",
      "courage or energy in these few drops of water?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Courage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see you just as feeble-minded as you were before, and still\r\n",
      "expressing only despair!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What sort of a man was this I had to do with, and what schemes was he\r\n",
      "now revolving in his fearless mind?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! you won't go back?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Should I renounce this expedition just when we have the fairest\r\n",
      "chance of success! Never!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then must we resign ourselves to destruction?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Axel, no; go back. Hans will go with you. Leave me to myself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Leave you here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Leave me, I tell you. I have undertaken this expedition. I will\r\n",
      "carry it out to the end, and I will not return. Go, Axel, go!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle was in high state of excitement. His voice, which had for a\r\n",
      "moment been tender and gentle, had now become hard and threatening.\r\n",
      "He was struggling with gloomy resolutions against impossibilities. I\r\n",
      "would not leave him in this bottomless abyss, and on the other hand\r\n",
      "the instinct of self-preservation prompted me to fly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The guide watched this scene with his usual phlegmatic unconcern. Yet\r\n",
      "he understood perfectly well what was going on between his two\r\n",
      "companions. The gestures themselves were sufficient to show that we\r\n",
      "were each bent on taking a different road; but Hans seemed to take no\r\n",
      "part in a question upon which depended his life. He was ready to\r\n",
      "start at a given signal, or to stay, if his master so willed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How I wished at this moment I could have made him understand me. My\r\n",
      "words, my complaints, my sorrow would have had some influence over\r\n",
      "that frigid nature. Those dangers which our guide could not\r\n",
      "understand I could have demonstrated and proved to him. Together we\r\n",
      "might have over-ruled the obstinate Professor; if it were needed, we\r\n",
      "might perhaps have compelled him to regain the heights of Snæfell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I drew near to Hans. I placed my hand upon his. He made no movement.\r\n",
      "My parted lips sufficiently revealed my sufferings. The Icelander\r\n",
      "slowly moved his head, and calmly pointing to my uncle said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Master.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Master!\" I shouted; \"you madman! no, he is not the master of our\r\n",
      "life; we must fly, we must drag him. Do you hear me? Do you\r\n",
      "understand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had seized Hans by the arm. I wished to oblige him to rise. I\r\n",
      "strove with him. My uncle interposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Be calm, Axel! you will get nothing from that immovable servant.\r\n",
      "Therefore, listen to my proposal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I crossed my arms, and confronted my uncle boldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The want of water,\" he said, \"is the only obstacle in our way. In\r\n",
      "this eastern gallery made up of lavas, schists, and coal, we have not\r\n",
      "met with a single particle of moisture. Perhaps we shall be more\r\n",
      "fortunate if we follow the western tunnel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shook my head incredulously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hear me to the end,\" the Professor went on with a firm voice.\r\n",
      "\"Whilst you were lying there motionless, I went to examine the\r\n",
      "conformation of that gallery. It penetrates directly downward, and in\r\n",
      "a few hours it will bring us to the granite rocks. There we must meet\r\n",
      "with abundant springs. The nature of the rock assures me of this, and\r\n",
      "instinct agrees with logic to support my conviction. Now, this is my\r\n",
      "proposal. When Columbus asked of his ships' crews for three days more\r\n",
      "to discover a new world, those crews, disheartened and sick as they\r\n",
      "were, recognised the justice of the claim, and he discovered America.\r\n",
      "I am the Columbus of this nether world, and I only ask for one more\r\n",
      "day. If in a single day I have not met with the water that we want, I\r\n",
      "swear to you we will return to the surface of the earth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of my irritation I was moved with these words, as well as\r\n",
      "with the violence my uncle was doing to his own wishes in making so\r\n",
      "hazardous a proposal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" I said, \"do as you will, and God reward your superhuman\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Here are primitive rocks. Now we are in the right way. Forward!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When in its early stages the earth was slowly cooling, its\r\n",
      "contraction gave rise in its crust to disruptions, distortions,\r\n",
      "fissures, and chasms. The passage through which we were moving was\r\n",
      "such a fissure, through which at one time granite poured out in a\r\n",
      "molten state. Its thousands of windings formed an inextricable\r\n",
      "labyrinth through the primeval mass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As fast as we descended, the succession of beds forming the primitive\r\n",
      "foundation came out with increasing distinctness. Geologists consider\r\n",
      "this primitive matter to be the base of the mineral crust of the\r\n",
      "earth, and have ascertained it to be composed of three different\r\n",
      "formations, schist, gneiss, and mica schist, resting upon that\r\n",
      "unchangeable foundation, the granite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Never had mineralogists found themselves in so marvellous a situation\r\n",
      "to study nature in situ. What the boring machine, an insensible,\r\n",
      "inert instrument, was unable to bring to the surface of the inner\r\n",
      "structure of the globe, we were able to peruse with our own eyes and\r\n",
      "handle with our own hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Through the beds of schist, coloured with delicate shades of green,\r\n",
      "ran in winding course threads of copper and manganese, with traces of\r\n",
      "platinum and gold. I thought, what riches are here buried at an\r\n",
      "unapproachable depth in the earth, hidden for ever from the covetous\r\n",
      "eyes of the human race! These treasures have been buried at such a\r\n",
      "profound depth by the convulsions of primeval times that they run no\r\n",
      "chance of ever being molested by the pickaxe or the spade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the schists succeeded gneiss, partially stratified, remarkable for\r\n",
      "the parallelism and regularity of its lamina, then mica schists, laid\r\n",
      "in large plates or flakes, revealing their lamellated structure by\r\n",
      "the sparkle of the white shining mica.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The light from our apparatus, reflected from the small facets of\r\n",
      "quartz, shot sparkling rays at every angle, and I seemed to be moving\r\n",
      "through a diamond, within which the quickly darting rays broke across\r\n",
      "each other in a thousand flashing coruscations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About six o'clock this brilliant fete of illuminations underwent a\r\n",
      "sensible abatement of splendour, then almost ceased. The walls\r\n",
      "assumed a crystallised though sombre appearance; mica was more\r\n",
      "closely mingled with the feldspar and quartz to form the proper rocky\r\n",
      "foundations of the earth, which bears without distortion or crushing\r\n",
      "the weight of the four terrestrial systems. We were immured within\r\n",
      "prison walls of granite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was eight in the evening. No signs of water had yet appeared. I\r\n",
      "was suffering horribly. My uncle strode on. He refused to stop. He\r\n",
      "was listening anxiously for the murmur of distant springs. But, no,\r\n",
      "there was dead silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now my limbs were failing beneath me. I resisted pain and\r\n",
      "torture, that I might not stop my uncle, which would have driven him\r\n",
      "to despair, for the day was drawing near to its end, and it was his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Come to me, I am dying.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle retraced his steps. He gazed upon me with his arms crossed;\r\n",
      "then these muttered words passed his lips:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's all over!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last thing I saw was a fearful gesture of rage, and my eyes\r\n",
      "closed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I reopened them I saw my two companions motionless and rolled up\r\n",
      "in their coverings. Were they asleep? As for me, I could not get one\r\n",
      "moment's sleep. I was suffering too keenly, and what embittered my\r\n",
      "thoughts was that there was no remedy. My uncle's last words echoed\r\n",
      "painfully in my ears: \"it's all over!\" For in such a fearful state of\r\n",
      "debility it was madness to think of ever reaching the upper world\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had above us a league and a half of terrestrial crust. The weight\r\n",
      "of it seemed to be crushing down upon my shoulders. I felt weighed\r\n",
      "down, and I exhausted myself with imaginary violent exertions to turn\r\n",
      "round upon my granite couch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few hours passed away. A deep silence reigned around us, the\r\n",
      "silence of the grave. No sound could reach us through walls, the\r\n",
      "thinnest of which were five miles thick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet in the midst of my stupefaction I seemed to be aware of a noise.\r\n",
      "It was dark down the tunnel, but I seemed to see the Icelander\r\n",
      "vanishing from our sight with the lamp in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why was he leaving us? Was Hans going to forsake us? My uncle was\r\n",
      "fast asleep. I wanted to shout, but my voice died upon my parched and\r\n",
      "swollen lips. The darkness became deeper, and the last sound died\r\n",
      "away in the far distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hans has abandoned us,\" I cried. \"Hans! Hans!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But these words were only spoken within me. They went no farther. Yet\r\n",
      "after the first moment of terror I felt ashamed of suspecting a man\r\n",
      "of such extraordinary faithfulness. Instead of ascending he was\r\n",
      "descending the gallery. An evil design would have taken him up not\r\n",
      "down. This reflection restored me to calmness, and I turned to other\r\n",
      "thoughts. None but some weighty motive could have induced so quiet a\r\n",
      "man to forfeit his sleep. Was he on a journey of discovery? Had he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Water! water!\" I cried, clapping my hands and gesticulating like a\r\n",
      "madman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Water!\" repeated my uncle. \"Hvar?\" he asked, in Icelandic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Nedat,_\" replied Hans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where? Down below!\" I understood it all. I seized the hunter's\r\n",
      "hands, and pressed them while he looked on me without moving a muscle\r\n",
      "of his countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The preparations for our departure were not long in making, and we\r\n",
      "were soon on our way down a passage inclining two feet in seven. In\r\n",
      "an hour we had gone a mile and a quarter, and descended two thousand\r\n",
      "feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something\r\n",
      "running within the thickness of the granite wall, a kind of dull,\r\n",
      "dead rumbling, like distant thunder. During the first part of our\r\n",
      "walk, not meeting with the promised spring, I felt my agony\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We hurried forward in the greatest excitement. I was no longer\r\n",
      "sensible of my fatigue. This murmuring of waters close at hand was\r\n",
      "already refreshing me. It was audibly increasing. The torrent, after\r\n",
      "having for some time flowed over our heads, was now running within\r\n",
      "the left wall, roaring and rushing. Frequently I touched the wall,\r\n",
      "hoping to feel some indications of moisture: But there was no hope\r\n",
      "here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet another half hour, another half league was passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then it became clear that the hunter had gone no farther. Guided by\r\n",
      "an instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this\r\n",
      "torrent through the rock; but he had certainly seen none of the\r\n",
      "precious liquid; he had drunk nothing himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We returned. Hans stopped where the torrent seemed closest. I sat\r\n",
      "near the wall, while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of\r\n",
      "two feet with extreme violence. But there was a thick granite wall\r\n",
      "between us and the object of our desires.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without reflection, without asking if there were any means of\r\n",
      "procuring the water, I gave way to a movement of despair.\r\n",

      "Hans glanced at me with, I thought, a smile of compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose and took the lamp. I followed him. He moved towards the wall.\r\n",
      "I looked on. He applied his ear against the dry stone, and moved it\r\n",
      "slowly to and fro, listening intently. I perceived at once that he\r\n",
      "was examining to find the exact place where the torrent could be\r\n",
      "heard the loudest. He met with that point on the left side of the\r\n",
      "tunnel, at three feet from the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was stirred up with excitement. I hardly dared guess what the\r\n",
      "hunter was about to do. But I could not but understand, and applaud\r\n",

      "\"We are saved!\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" cried my uncle, almost frantic with excitement. \"Hans is\r\n",
      "right. Capital fellow! Who but he would have thought of it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes; who but he? Such an expedient, however simple, would never have\r\n",
      "entered into our minds. True, it seemed most hazardous to strike a\r\n",
      "blow of the hammer in this part of the earth's structure. Suppose\r\n",
      "some displacement should occur and crush us all! Suppose the torrent,\r\n",
      "bursting through, should drown us in a sudden flood! There was\r\n",
      "nothing vain in these fancies. But still no fears of falling rocks or\r\n",
      "rushing floods could stay us now; and our thirst was so intense that,\r\n",
      "to satisfy it, we would have dared the waves of the north Atlantic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans set about the task which my uncle and I together could not have\r\n",
      "accomplished. If our impatience had armed our hands with power, we\r\n",
      "should have shattered the rock into a thousand fragments. Not so\r\n",
      "Hans. Full of self possession, he calmly wore his way through the\r\n",
      "rock with a steady succession of light and skilful strokes, working\r\n",
      "through an aperture six inches wide at the outside. I could hear a\r\n",
      "louder noise of flowing waters, and I fancied I could feel the\r\n",
      "delicious fluid refreshing my parched lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pick had soon penetrated two feet into the granite partition, and\r\n",
      "our man had worked for above an hour. I was in an agony of\r\n",
      "impatience. My uncle wanted to employ stronger measures, and I had\r\n",
      "some difficulty in dissuading him; still he had just taken a pickaxe\r\n",
      "in his hand, when a sudden hissing was heard, and a jet of water\r\n",
      "spurted out with violence against the opposite wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans, almost thrown off his feet by the violence of the shock,\r\n",
      "uttered a cry of grief and disappointment, of which I soon under-.\r\n",
      "stood the cause, when plunging my hands into the spouting torrent, I\r\n",
      "withdrew them in haste, for the water was scalding hot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The water is at the boiling point,\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, never mind, let it cool,\" my uncle replied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tunnel was filling with steam, whilst a stream was forming, which\r\n",
      "by degrees wandered away into subterranean windings, and soon we had\r\n",
      "the satisfaction of swallowing our first draught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Could anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning\r\n",
      "intolerable thirst was passing away, and leaving us to enjoy comfort\r\n",
      "and pleasure? But where was this water from? No matter. It was water;\r\n",
      "and though still warm, it brought life back to the dying. I kept\r\n",
      "drinking without stopping, and almost without tasting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last after a most delightful time of reviving energy, I cried,\r\n",
      "\"Why, this is a chalybeate spring!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing could be better for the digestion,\" said my uncle. \"It is\r\n",
      "highly impregnated with iron. It will be as good for us as going to\r\n",
      "the Spa, or to Töplitz.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it is delicious!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course it is, water should be, found six miles underground. It\r\n",
      "has an inky flavour, which is not at all unpleasant. What a capital\r\n",
      "source of strength Hans has found for us here. We will call it after\r\n",
      "his name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Agreed,\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Hansbach it was from that moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans was none the prouder. After a moderate draught, he went quietly\r\n",
      "into a corner to rest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" I said, \"we must not lose this water.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the use of troubling ourselves?\" my uncle, replied. \"I fancy\r\n",
      "it will never fail.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind, we cannot be sure; let us fill the water bottle and our\r\n",
      "flasks, and then stop up the opening.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My advice was followed so far as getting in a supply; but the\r\n",
      "stopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish. It was in vain\r\n",
      "that we took up fragments of granite, and stuffed them in with tow,\r\n",
      "we only scalded our hands without succeeding. The pressure was too\r\n",
      "great, and our efforts were fruitless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is quite plain,\" said I, \"that the higher body of this water is\r\n",
      "at a considerable elevation. The force of the jet shows that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No doubt,\" answered my uncle. \"If this column of water is 32,000\r\n",
      "feet high--that is, from the surface of the earth, it is equal to\r\n",
      "the weight of a thousand atmospheres. But I have got an idea.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why should we trouble ourselves to stop the stream from coming out\r\n",
      "at all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because--\" Well, I could not assign a reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When our flasks are empty, where shall we fill them again? Can we\r\n",
      "tell that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No; there was no certainty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, let us allow the water to run on. It will flow down, and will\r\n",
      "both guide and refresh us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is well planned,\" I cried. \"With this stream for our guide,\r\n",
      "there is no reason why we should not succeed in our undertaking.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, my boy! you agree with me now,\" cried the Professor, laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I agree with you most heartily.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, let us rest awhile; and then we will start again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was forgetting that it was night. The chronometer soon informed me\r\n",
      "of that fact; and in a very short time, refreshed and thankful, we\r\n",

      "By the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings. At first, I was\r\n",
      "wondering that I was no longer thirsty, and I was for asking for the\r\n",
      "reason. The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We breakfasted, and drank of this excellent chalybeate water. I felt\r\n",
      "wonderfully stronger, and quite decided upon pushing on. Why should\r\n",
      "not so firmly convinced a man as my uncle, furnished with so\r\n",
      "industrious a guide as Hans, and accompanied by so determined a\r\n",
      "nephew as myself, go on to final success? Such were the magnificent\r\n",
      "plans which struggled for mastery within me. If it had been proposed\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Most fortunately, all we had to do was to descend.\r\n",

      "vaulted hollows of the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Thursday, at 8 a.m., we started afresh. The granite tunnel winding\r\n",
      "from side to side, earned us past unexpected turns, and seemed almost\r\n",
      "to form a labyrinth; but, on the whole, its direction seemed to be\r\n",
      "south-easterly. My uncle never ceased to consult his compass, to keep\r\n",
      "account of the ground gone over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal,\r\n",
      "scarcely more than two inches in a fathom, and the stream ran gently\r\n",
      "murmuring at our feet. I compared it to a friendly genius guiding us\r\n",
      "underground, and caressed with my hand the soft naiad, whose\r\n",
      "comforting voice accompanied our steps. With my reviving spirits\r\n",
      "these mythological notions seemed to come unbidden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for my uncle, he was beginning to storm against the horizontal\r\n",
      "road. He loved nothing better than a vertical path; but this way\r\n",
      "seemed indefinitely prolonged, and instead of sliding along the\r\n",
      "hypothenuse as we were now doing, he would willingly have dropped\r\n",
      "down the terrestrial radius. But there was no help for it, and as\r\n",
      "long as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must\r\n",
      "not complain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From time to time, a steeper path appeared; our naiad then began to\r\n",
      "tumble before us with a hoarser murmur, and we went down with her to\r\n",
      "a greater depth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the whole, that day and the next we made considerable way\r\n",
      "horizontally, very little vertically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Friday evening, the 10th of July, according to our calculations,\r\n",
      "we were thirty leagues south-east of Rejkiavik, and at a depth of two\r\n",
      "leagues and a half.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At our feet there now opened a frightful abyss. My uncle, however,\r\n",
      "was not to be daunted, and he clapped his hands at the steepness of\r\n",
      "the descent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This will take us a long way,\" he cried, \"and without much\r\n",
      "difficulty; for the projections in the rock form quite a staircase.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ropes were so fastened by Hans as to guard against accident, and\r\n",
      "the descent commenced. I can hardly call it perilous, for I was\r\n",
      "beginning to be familiar with this kind of exercise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This well, or abyss, was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite,\r\n",
      "called by geologists a 'fault,' and caused by the unequal cooling of\r\n",
      "the globe of the earth. If it had at one time been a passage for\r\n",
      "eruptive matter thrown out by Snæfell, I still could not understand\r\n",
      "why no trace was left of its passage. We kept going down a kind of\r\n",
      "winding staircase, which seemed almost to have been made by the hand\r\n",
      "of man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt, to take a little\r\n",
      "necessary repose and restore the action of our limbs. We then sat\r\n",
      "down upon a fragment of rock, and we talked as we ate and drank from\r\n",
      "the stream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, down this fault the Hansbach fell in a cascade, and lost\r\n",
      "some of its volume; but there was enough and to spare to slake our\r\n",
      "thirst. Besides, when the incline became more gentle, it would of\r\n",
      "course resume its peaceable course. At this moment it reminded me of\r\n",
      "my worthy uncle, in his frequent fits of impatience and anger, while\r\n",
      "below it ran with the calmness of the Icelandic hunter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the 6th and 7th of July we kept following the spiral curves of\r\n",
      "this singular well, penetrating in actual distance no more than two\r\n",
      "leagues; but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level\r\n",
      "of the sea. But on the 8th, about noon, the fault took, towards the\r\n",
      "south-east, a much gentler slope, one of about forty-five degrees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the road became monotonously easy. It could not be otherwise,\r\n",
      "for there was no landscape to vary the stages of our journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Wednesday, the 15th, we were seven leagues underground, and had\r\n",
      "travelled fifty leagues away from Snæfell. Although we were tired,\r\n",
      "our health was perfect, and the medicine chest had not yet had\r\n",
      "occasion to be opened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass, the\r\n",
      "chronometer, the aneroid, and the thermometer the very same which he\r\n",
      "has published in his scientific report of our journey. It was\r\n",
      "therefore not difficult to know exactly our whereabouts. When he told\r\n",
      "me that we had gone fifty leagues horizontally, I could not repress\r\n",
      "an exclamation of astonishment, at the thought that we had now long\r\n",
      "left Iceland behind us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" he cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no\r\n",
      "longer under Iceland.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you think so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am not mistaken,\" I said, and examining the map, I added, \"We have\r\n",
      "passed Cape Portland, and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide\r\n",
      "expanse of ocean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Under the sea,\" my uncle repeated, rubbing his hands with delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can it be?\" I said. \"Is the ocean spread above our heads?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, Axel. What can be more natural? At Newcastle are there\r\n",
      "not coal mines extending far under the sea?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was all very well for the Professor to call this so simple, but I\r\n",
      "could not feel quite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was\r\n",
      "rolling over my head. And yet it really mattered very little whether\r\n",
      "it was the plains and mountains that covered our heads, or the\r\n",
      "Atlantic waves, as long as we were arched over by solid granite. And,\r\n",
      "besides, I was getting used to this idea; for the tunnel, now running\r\n",
      "straight, now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its\r\n",
      "turnings, but constantly preserving its south-easterly direction, and\r\n",
      "always running deeper, was gradually carrying us to very great depths\r\n",
      "indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four days later, Saturday, the 18th of July, in the evening, we\r\n",
      "arrived at a kind of vast grotto; and here my uncle paid Hans his\r\n",
      "weekly wages, and it was settled that the next day, Sunday, should be\r\n",

      "long retreat, the simultaneous cry, \"Thalatta! thalatta!\" the sea!\r\n",
      "the sea! The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine\r\n",
      "shining sand, softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small\r\n",
      "shells which had been inhabited by the first of created beings. The\r\n",
      "waves broke on this shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to\r\n",
      "vast inclosed spaces. A light foam flew over the waves before the\r\n",
      "breath of a moderate breeze, and some of the spray fell upon my face.\r\n",
      "On this slightly inclining shore, about a hundred fathoms from the\r\n",
      "limit of the waves, came down the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs,\r\n",
      "which rose majestically to an enormous height. Some of these,\r\n",
      "dividing the beach with their sharp spurs, formed capes and\r\n",
      "promontories, worn away by the ceaseless action of the surf. Farther\r\n",
      "on the eye discerned their massive outline sharply defined against\r\n",
      "the hazy distant horizon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert\r\n",
      "and frightfully wild in appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea, it was\r\n",
      "because a peculiar light brought to view every detail of it. It was\r\n",
      "not the light of the sun, with his dazzling shafts of brightness and\r\n",
      "the splendour of his rays; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer\r\n",
      "of the moonbeams, the dim reflection of a nobler body of light. No;\r\n",
      "the illuminating power of this light, its trembling diffusiveness,\r\n",
      "its bright, clear whiteness, and its low temperature, showed that it\r\n",
      "must be of electric origin. It was like an aurora borealis, a\r\n",
      "continuous cosmical phenomenon, filling a cavern of sufficient extent\r\n",
      "to contain an ocean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The vault that spanned the space above, the sky, if it could be\r\n",
      "called so, seemed composed of vast plains of cloud, shifting and\r\n",
      "variable vapours, which by their condensation must at certain times\r\n",
      "fall in torrents of rain. I should have thought that under so\r\n",
      "powerful a pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation;\r\n",
      "and yet, under a law unknown to me, there were broad tracts of vapour\r\n",
      "suspended in the air. But then 'the weather was fine.' The play of\r\n",
      "the electric light produced singular effects upon the upper strata of\r\n",
      "cloud. Deep shadows reposed upon their lower wreaths; and often,\r\n",
      "between two separated fields of cloud, there glided down a ray of\r\n",
      "unspeakable lustre. But it was not solar light, and there was no\r\n",
      "heat. The general effect was sad, supremely melancholy. Instead of\r\n",
      "the shining firmament, spangled with its innumerable stars, shining\r\n",
      "singly or in clusters, I felt that all these subdued and shaded\r\n",
      "lights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite, which seemed to\r\n",
      "overpower me with their weight, and that all this space, great as it\r\n",
      "was, would not be enough for the march of the humblest of satellites.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I remembered the theory of an English captain, who likened the\r\n",
      "earth to a vast hollow sphere, in the interior of which the air\r\n",
      "became luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it;\r\n",
      "while two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, rolled within upon the circuit\r\n",
      "of their mysterious orbits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation. Its\r\n",
      "width could not be estimated, since the shore ran widening as far as\r\n",
      "eye could reach, nor could its length, for the dim horizon bounded\r\n",
      "the new. As for its height, it must have been several leagues. Where\r\n",
      "this vault rested upon its granite base no eye could tell; but there\r\n",
      "was a cloud hanging far above, the height of which we estimated at\r\n",
      "12,000 feet, a greater height than that of any terrestrial vapour,\r\n",
      "and no doubt due to the great density of the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space; words\r\n",
      "of human tongue are inadequate to describe the discoveries of him who\r\n",
      "ventures into the deep abysses of earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Besides I could not tell upon what geological theory to account for\r\n",
      "the existence of such an excavation. Had the cooling of the globe\r\n",
      "produced it? I knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of\r\n",
      "travellers, but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If the grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by Humboldt, had not\r\n",
      "given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher, who\r\n",
      "investigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet, it probably did not\r\n",
      "extend much farther. The immense mammoth cave in Kentucky is of\r\n",
      "gigantic proportions, since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet\r\n",
      "[1] above the level of an unfathomable lake and travellers have\r\n",
      "explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles. But what\r\n",
      "were these cavities compared to that in which I stood with wonder and\r\n",
      "admiration, with its sky of luminous vapours, its bursts of electric\r\n",
      "light, and a vast sea filling its bed? My imagination fell powerless\r\n",
      "before such immensity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I gazed upon these wonders in silence. Words failed me to express my\r\n",
      "feelings. I felt as if I was in some distant planet Uranus or\r\n",
      "Neptune--and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial\r\n",
      "experience gave me no cognisance. For such novel sensations, new words\r\n",
      "were wanted; and my imagination failed to supply them. I gazed, I\r\n",
      "thought, I admired, with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of\r\n",
      "fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my\r\n",
      "cheeks. I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of\r\n",
      "astonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system\r\n",
      "of therapeutics; besides, the dense and breezy air invigorated me,\r\n",
      "supplying more oxygen to my lungs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven\r\n",
      "days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to\r\n",
      "breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[1] One hundred and twenty. (Trans.)\r\n",

      "I was delighted to leave my dark grotto. My uncle, already familiar\r\n",
      "with these wonders, had ceased to feel surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, certainly; and nothing could be more delightful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, take my arm, Axel, and let us follow the windings of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I eagerly accepted, and we began to coast along this new sea. On the\r\n",
      "left huge pyramids of rock, piled one upon another, produced a\r\n",
      "prodigious titanic effect. Down their sides flowed numberless\r\n",
      "waterfalls, which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams.\r\n",
      "A few light vapours, leaping from rock to rock, denoted the place of\r\n",

      "sea, just as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the\r\n",
      "world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall see it no more,\" I said, with a sigh.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight. At\r\n",
      "a distance of five hundred paces, at the turn of a high promontory,\r\n",
      "appeared a high, tufted, dense forest. It was composed of trees of\r\n",
      "moderate height, formed like umbrellas, with exact geometrical\r\n",
      "outlines. The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon\r\n",
      "their shape, and in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved\r\n",
      "and firm, just like a clump of petrified cedars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hastened forward. I could not give any name to these singular\r\n",
      "creations. Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of\r\n",
      "vegetables known hitherto, and did they claim a place of their own in\r\n",
      "the lacustrine flora? No; when we arrived under their shade my\r\n",
      "surprise turned into admiration. There stood before me productions of\r\n",
      "earth, but of gigantic stature, which my uncle immediately named.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is only a forest of mushrooms,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he was right. Imagine the large development attained by these\r\n",
      "plants, which prefer a warm, moist climate. I knew that the\r\n",
      "_Lycopodon giganteum_ attains, according to Bulliard, a circumference\r\n",
      "of eight or nine feet; but here were pale mushrooms, thirty to forty\r\n",
      "feet high, and crowned with a cap of equal diameter. There they stood\r\n",
      "in thousands. No light could penetrate between their huge cones, and\r\n",
      "complete darkness reigned beneath those giants; they formed\r\n",
      "settlements of domes placed in close array like the round, thatched\r\n",
      "roofs of a central African city.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet I wanted to penetrate farther underneath, though a chill fell\r\n",
      "upon me as soon as I came under those cellular vaults. For half an\r\n",
      "hour we wandered from side to side in the damp shades, and it was a\r\n",
      "comfortable and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea\r\n",
      "shore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi.\r\n",
      "Farther on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy\r\n",
      "to recognise. They were lowly shrubs of earth, here attaining\r\n",
      "gigantic size; lycopodiums, a hundred feet high; the huge sigillaria,\r\n",
      "found in our coal mines; tree ferns, as tall as our fir-trees in\r\n",
      "northern latitudes; lepidodendra, with cylindrical forked stems,\r\n",
      "terminated by long leaves, and bristling with rough hairs like those\r\n",
      "of the cactus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wonderful, magnificent, splendid!\" cried my uncle. \"Here is the\r\n",
      "entire flora of the second period of the world--the transition\r\n",
      "period. These, humble garden plants with us, were tall trees in the\r\n",
      "early ages. Look, Axel, and admire it all. Never had botanist such a\r\n",
      "feast as this!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are right, my uncle. Providence seems to have preserved in this\r\n",
      "immense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of\r\n",
      "philosophers has so sagaciously put together again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Surely not a menagerie!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; no doubt of it. Look at that dust under your feet; see the\r\n",
      "bones scattered on the ground.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So there are!\" I cried; \"bones of extinct animals.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had rushed upon these remains, formed of indestructible phosphates\r\n",
      "of lime, and without hesitation I named these monstrous bones, which\r\n",
      "lay scattered about like decayed trunks of trees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here is the lower jaw of a mastodon,\" [1] I said. \"These are the\r\n",
      "molar teeth of the deinotherium; this femur must have belonged to the\r\n",
      "greatest of those beasts, the megatherium. It certainly is a\r\n",
      "menagerie, for these remains were not brought here by a deluge. The\r\n",
      "animals to which they belonged roamed on the shores of this\r\n",
      "subterranean sea, under the shade of those arborescent trees. Here\r\n",
      "are entire skeletons. And yet I cannot understand the appearance of\r\n",
      "these quadrupeds in a granite cavern.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[1] These animals belonged to a late geological period, the Pliocene,\r\n",
      "just before the glacial epoch, and therefore could have no connection\r\n",
      "with the carboniferous vegetation. (Trans.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because animal life existed upon the earth only in the secondary\r\n",
      "period, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers, and\r\n",
      "taken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Axel, there is a very simple answer to your objection that\r\n",
      "this soil is alluvial.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! at such a depth below the surface of the earth?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No doubt; and there is a geological explanation of the fact. At a\r\n",
      "certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark,\r\n",
      "alternately acted on by forces from above or below, according to the\r\n",
      "laws of attraction and gravitation. Probably there were subsidences\r\n",
      "of the outer crust, when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was\r\n",
      "carried down sudden openings.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That may be,\" I replied; \"but if there have been creatures now\r\n",
      "extinct in these underground regions, why may not some of those\r\n",
      "monsters be now roaming through these gloomy forests, or hidden\r\n",
      "behind the steep crags?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as this unpleasant notion got hold of me, I surveyed with anxious\r\n",
      "scrutiny the open spaces before me; but no living creature appeared\r\n",
      "upon the barren strand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt rather tired, and went to sit down at the end of a promontory,\r\n",
      "at the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray.\r\n",
      "Thence my eye could sweep every part of the bay; within its extremity\r\n",
      "a little harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs, where the\r\n",
      "still waters slept untouched by the boisterous winds. A brig and two\r\n",
      "or three schooners might have moored within it in safety. I almost\r\n",
      "fancied I should presently see some ship issue from it, full sail,\r\n",
      "and take to the open sea under the southern breeze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this illusion lasted a very short time. We were the only living\r\n",
      "creatures in this subterranean world. When the wind lulled, a deeper\r\n",
      "silence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid, naked rocks, and\r\n",
      "weighed upon the surface of the ocean. I then desired to pierce the\r\n",
      "distant haze, and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung\r\n",
      "across the horizon. Anxious queries arose to my lips. Where did that\r\n",
      "sea terminate? Where did it lead to? Should we ever know anything\r\n",
      "about its opposite shores?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle made no doubt about it at all; I both desired and feared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous\r\n",
      "spectacle, we returned to the shore to regain the grotto, and I fell\r\n",

      "\"Yes; with a westerly deviation of nineteen degrees forty-five\r\n",
      "minutes, just as above ground. As for its dip, a curious fact is\r\n",
      "coming to light, which I have observed carefully: that the needle,\r\n",
      "instead of dipping towards the pole as in the northern hemisphere, on\r\n",
      "the contrary, rises from it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "has built it of the best materials; and never could man have given it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It is fir, pine, or birch, and other northern coniferae, mineralised\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Sometimes that may happen; some of these woods become true\r\n",
      "anthracites; but others, such as this, have only gone through the\r\n",

      "throwing into the sea one of those precious waifs.\r\n",

      "anterior part of its body was plated with bony, angular scales; it\r\n",
      "had no teeth, its pectoral fins were large, and of tail there was\r\n",
      "none. The animal belonged to the same order as the sturgeon, but\r\n",
      "differed from that fish in many essential particulars. After a short\r\n",

      "and a species of pterichthys. But this one displays a peculiarity\r\n",
      "confined to all fishes that inhabit subterranean waters. It is blind,\r\n",
      "and not only blind, but actually has no eyes at all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked: nothing could be more certain. But supposing it might be a\r\n",
      "solitary case, we baited afresh, and threw out our line. Surely this\r\n",
      "ocean is well peopled with fish, for in another couple of hours we\r\n",
      "took a large quantity of pterichthydes, as well as of others\r\n",
      "belonging to the extinct family of the dipterides, but of which my\r\n",
      "uncle could not tell the species; none had organs of sight. This\r\n",
      "unhoped-for catch recruited our stock of provisions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus it is evident that this sea contains none but species known to\r\n",
      "us in their fossil state, in which fishes as well as reptiles are the\r\n",
      "less perfectly and completely organised the farther back their date\r\n",
      "of creation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps we may yet meet with some of those saurians which science has\r\n",
      "reconstructed out of a bit of bone or cartilage. I took up the\r\n",

      "desert sea. We are far away removed from the shores.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Still my imagination carried me away amongst the wonderful\r\n",
      "speculations of palæontology. Though awake I fell into a dream. I\r\n",
      "thought I could see floating on the surface of the waters enormous\r\n",
      "chelonia, pre-adamite tortoises, resembling floating islands. Over the\r\n",
      "dimly lighted strand there trod the huge mammals of the first ages of\r\n",
      "the world, the leptotherium (slender beast), found in the caverns of\r\n",
      "Brazil; the merycotherium (ruminating beast), found in the 'drift' of\r\n",
      "iceclad Siberia. Farther on, the pachydermatous lophiodon (crested\r\n",
      "toothed), a gigantic tapir, hides behind the rocks to dispute its\r\n",
      "prey with the anoplotherium (unarmed beast), a strange creature,\r\n",
      "which seemed a compound of horse, rhinoceros, camel, and\r\n",
      "hippopotamus. The colossal mastodon (nipple-toothed) twists and\r\n",
      "untwists his trunk, and brays and pounds with his huge tusks the\r\n",
      "fragments of rock that cover the shore; whilst the megatherium (huge\r\n",
      "beast), buttressed upon his enormous hinder paws, grubs in the soil,\r\n",
      "awaking the sonorous echoes of the granite rocks with his tremendous\r\n",
      "roarings. Higher up, the protopitheca--the first monkey that\r\n",
      "appeared on the globe--is climbing up the steep ascents. Higher yet,\r\n",
      "the pterodactyle (wing-fingered) darts in irregular zigzags to and\r\n",
      "fro in the heavy air. In the uppermost regions of the air immense\r\n",
      "birds, more powerful than the cassowary, and larger than the ostrich,\r\n",

      "world was as yet unfitted for his support. Then my dream backed even\r\n",
      "farther still into the ages before the creation of living beings. The\r\n",
      "mammals disappear, then the birds vanish, then the reptiles of the\r\n",
      "secondary period, and finally the fish, the crustaceans, molluscs,\r\n",

      "\"No; but we have got to the end of that endless sea. Now we shall go\r\n",
      "by land, and really begin to go down! down! down!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, my dear uncle, do let me ask you one question.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, Axel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How about returning?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Returning? Why, you are talking about the return before the arrival.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I only want to know how that is to be managed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the simplest way possible. When we have reached the centre of the\r\n",
      "globe, either we shall find some new way to get back, or we shall\r\n",
      "come back like decent folks the way we came. I feel pleased at the\r\n",
      "thought that it is sure not to be shut against us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But then we shall have to refit the raft.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then, as to provisions, have we enough to last?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; to be sure we have. Hans is a clever fellow, and I am sure he\r\n",
      "must have saved a large part of our cargo. But still let us go and\r\n",
      "make sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We left this grotto which lay open to every wind. At the same time I\r\n",
      "cherished a trembling hope which was a fear as well. It seemed to me\r\n",
      "impossible that the terrible wreck of the raft should not have\r\n",
      "destroyed everything on board. On my arrival on the shore I found\r\n",
      "Hans surrounded by an assemblage of articles all arranged in good\r\n",
      "order. My uncle shook hands with him with a lively gratitude. This\r\n",
      "man, with almost superhuman devotion, had been at work all the while\r\n",
      "that we were asleep, and had saved the most precious of the articles\r\n",
      "at the risk of his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not that we had suffered no losses. For instance, our firearms; but\r\n",
      "we might do without them. Our stock of powder had remained uninjured\r\n",
      "after having risked blowing up during the storm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" cried the Professor, \"as we have no guns we cannot hunt,\r\n",
      "that's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but how about the instruments?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here is the aneroid, the most useful of all, and for which I would\r\n",
      "have given all the others. By means of it I can calculate the depth\r\n",
      "and know when we have reached the centre; without it we might very\r\n",
      "likely go beyond, and come out at the antipodes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such high spirits as these were rather too strong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But where is the compass? I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here it is, upon this rock, in perfect condition, as well as the\r\n",
      "thermometers and the chronometer. The hunter is a splendid fellow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no denying it. We had all our instruments. As for tools and\r\n",
      "appliances, there they all lay on the ground--ladders, ropes, picks,\r\n",
      "spades, etc.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still there was the question of provisions to be settled, and I\r\n",
      "asked--\"How are we off for provisions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boxes containing these were in a line upon the shore, in a\r\n",
      "perfect state of preservation; for the most part the sea had spared\r\n",
      "them, and what with biscuits, salt meat, spirits, and salt fish, we\r\n",
      "might reckon on four months' supply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four months!\" cried the Professor. \"We have time to go and to\r\n",
      "return; and with what is left I will give a grand dinner to my\r\n",
      "friends at the Johannæum.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ought by this time to have been quite accustomed to my uncle's\r\n",
      "ways; yet there was always something fresh about him to astonish me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" said he, \"we will replenish our supply of water with the rain\r\n",
      "which the storm has left in all these granite basins; therefore we\r\n",
      "shall have no reason to fear anything from thirst. As for the raft, I\r\n",
      "will recommend Hans to do his best to repair it, although I don't\r\n",
      "expect it will be of any further use to us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How so?\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An idea of my own, my lad. I don't think we shall come out by the\r\n",
      "way that we went in.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stared at the Professor with a good deal of mistrust. I asked, was\r\n",
      "he not touched in the brain? And yet there was method in his madness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now let us go to breakfast,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I followed him to a headland, after he had given his instructions to\r\n",
      "the hunter. There preserved meat, biscuit, and tea made us an\r\n",
      "excellent meal, one of the best I ever remember. Hunger, the fresh\r\n",
      "air, the calm quiet weather, after the commotions we had gone\r\n",
      "through, all contributed to give me a good appetite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst breakfasting I took the opportunity to put to my uncle the\r\n",
      "question where we were now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That seems to me,\" I said, \"rather difficult to make out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, it is difficult,\" he said, \"to calculate exactly; perhaps even\r\n",
      "impossible, since during these three stormy days I have been unable\r\n",
      "to keep any account of the rate or direction of the raft; but still\r\n",
      "we may get an approximation.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The last observation,\" I remarked, \"was made on the island, when the\r\n",
      "geyser was--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean Axel Island. Don't decline the honour of having given your\r\n",
      "name to the first island ever discovered in the central parts of the\r\n",
      "globe.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said I, \"let it be Axel Island. Then we had cleared two\r\n",
      "hundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were six hundred leagues\r\n",
      "from Iceland.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well,\" answered my uncle; \"let us start from that point and\r\n",
      "count four days' storm, during which our rate cannot have been less\r\n",
      "than eighty leagues in the twenty-four hours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is right; and this would make three hundred leagues more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and the Liedenbrock sea would be six hundred leagues from shore\r\n",
      "to shore. Surely, Axel, it may vie in size with the Mediterranean\r\n",
      "itself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Especially,\" I replied, \"if it happens that we have only crossed it\r\n",
      "in its narrowest part. And it is a curious circumstance,\" I added,\r\n",
      "\"that if my computations are right, and we are nine hundred leagues\r\n",
      "from Rejkiavik, we have now the Mediterranean above our head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is a good long way, my friend. But whether we are under Turkey\r\n",
      "or the Atlantic depends very much upon the question in what direction\r\n",
      "we have been moving. Perhaps we have deviated.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I think not. Our course has been the same all along, and I\r\n",
      "believe this shore is south-east of Port Gräuben.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" replied my uncle, \"we may easily ascertain this by consulting\r\n",
      "the compass. Let us go and see what it says.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Professor moved towards the rock upon which Hans had laid down\r\n",
      "the instruments. He was gay and full of spirits; he rubbed his hands,\r\n",
      "he studied his attitudes. I followed him, curious to know if I was\r\n",
      "right in my estimate. As soon as we had arrived at the rock my uncle\r\n",
      "took the compass, laid it horizontally, and questioned the needle,\r\n",
      "which, after a few oscillations, presently assumed a fixed position.\r\n",
      "My uncle looked, and looked, and looked again. He rubbed his eyes,\r\n",
      "and then turned to me thunderstruck with some unexpected discovery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He motioned to me to look. An exclamation of astonishment burst from\r\n",
      "me. The north pole of the needle was turned to what we supposed to be\r\n",
      "the south. It pointed to the shore instead of to the open sea! I\r\n",
      "shook the box, examined it again, it was in perfect condition. In\r\n",
      "whatever position I placed the box the needle pertinaciously returned\r\n",
      "to this unexpected quarter. Therefore there seemed no reason to doubt\r\n",
      "that during the storm there had been a sudden change of wind\r\n",
      "unperceived by us, which had brought our raft back to the shore which\r\n",
      "we thought we had left so long a distance behind us.\r\n",

      "stupefaction, then incredulity, lastly a downright burst of rage.\r\n",
      "Never had I seen the man so put out of countenance and so disturbed.\r\n",
      "The fatigues of our passage across, the dangers met, had all to be\r\n",
      "begun over again. We had gone backwards instead of forwards!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Aha! will fate play tricks upon me? Will the elements lay plots\r\n",

      "some restraint upon this unmeasured fanaticism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just listen to me,\" I said firmly. \"Ambition must have a limit\r\n",
      "somewhere; we cannot perform impossibilities; we are not at all fit\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I was able to develop this series of unanswerable reasons for ten\r\n",
      "minutes without interruption; not that the Professor was paying any\r\n",
      "respectful attention to his nephew's arguments, but because he was\r\n",
      "deaf to all my eloquence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the raft!\" he shouted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was his only reply. It was no use for me to entreat, supplicate,\r\n",

      "only have been opposing a will harder than the granite rock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans was finishing the repairs of the raft. One would have thought\r\n",
      "that this strange being was guessing at my uncle's intentions. With a\r\n",
      "few more pieces of surturbrand he had refitted our vessel. A sail\r\n",
      "already hung from the new mast, and the wind was playing in its\r\n",
      "waving folds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Professor said a few words to the guide, and immediately he put\r\n",
      "everything on board and arranged every necessary for our departure.\r\n",
      "The air was clear--and the north-west wind blew steadily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What could I do? Could I stand against the two? It was impossible? If\r\n",
      "Hans had but taken my side! But no, it was not to be. The Icelander\r\n",
      "seemed to have renounced all will of his own and made a vow to forget\r\n",
      "and deny himself. I could get nothing out of a servant so feudalised,\r\n",
      "as it were, to his master. My only course was to proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was therefore going with as much resignation as I could find to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "on this part of the coast, I will not leave it until I have examined\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To understand what followed, it must be borne in mind that, through\r\n",
      "circumstances hereafter to be explained, we were not really where the\r\n",
      "Professor supposed we were. In fact we were not upon the north shore\r\n",
      "of the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now let us start upon fresh discoveries,\" I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And leaving Hans to his work we started off together. The space\r\n",
      "between the water and the foot of the cliffs was considerable. It\r\n",
      "took half an hour to bring us to the wall of rock. We trampled under\r\n",
      "our feet numberless shells of all the forms and sizes which existed\r\n",
      "in the earliest ages of the world. I also saw immense carapaces more\r\n",
      "than fifteen feet in diameter. They had been the coverings of those\r\n",
      "gigantic glyptodons or armadilloes of the pleiocene period, of which\r\n",
      "the modern tortoise is but a miniature representative. [1] The soil\r\n",
      "was besides this scattered with stony fragments, boulders rounded by\r\n",
      "water action, and ridged up in successive lines. I was therefore led\r\n",
      "to the conclusion that at one time the sea must have covered the\r\n",
      "ground on which we were treading. On the loose and scattered rocks,\r\n",
      "now out of the reach of the highest tides, the waves had left\r\n",
      "manifest traces of their power to wear their way in the hardest stone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This might up to a certain point explain the existence of an ocean\r\n",
      "forty leagues beneath the surface of the globe. But in my opinion\r\n",
      "this liquid mass would be lost by degrees farther and farther within\r\n",
      "the interior of the earth, and it certainly had its origin in the\r\n",
      "waters of the ocean overhead, which had made their way hither through\r\n",
      "some fissure. Yet it must be believed that that fissure is now\r\n",
      "closed, and that all this cavern or immense reservoir was filled in a\r\n",
      "very short time. Perhaps even this water, subjected to the fierce\r\n",
      "action of central heat, had partly been resolved into vapour. This\r\n",
      "would explain the existence of those clouds suspended over our heads\r\n",
      "and the development of that electricity which raised such tempests\r\n",
      "within the bowels of the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This theory of the phenomena we had witnessed seemed satisfactory to\r\n",
      "me; for however great and stupendous the phenomena of nature, fixed\r\n",
      "physical laws will or may always explain them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were therefore walking upon sedimentary soil, the deposits of the\r\n",
      "waters of former ages. The Professor was carefully examining every\r\n",
      "little fissure in the rocks. Wherever he saw a hole he always wanted\r\n",
      "to know the depth of it. To him this was important.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had traversed the shores of the Liedenbrock sea for a mile when we\r\n",
      "observed a sudden change in the appearance of the soil. It seemed\r\n",
      "upset, contorted, and convulsed by a violent upheaval of the lower\r\n",
      "strata. In many places depressions or elevations gave witness to some\r\n",
      "tremendous power effecting the dislocation of strata.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[1] The glyptodon and armadillo are mammalian; the tortoise is a\r\n",
      "chelonian, a reptile, distinct classes of the animal kingdom;\r\n",

      "(Trans.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We moved with difficulty across these granite fissures and chasms\r\n",
      "mingled with silex, crystals of quartz, and alluvial deposits, when a\r\n",
      "field, nay, more than a field, a vast plain, of bleached bones lay\r\n",
      "spread before us. It seemed like an immense cemetery, where the\r\n",
      "remains of twenty ages mingled their dust together. Huge mounds of\r\n",
      "bony fragments rose stage after stage in the distance. They undulated\r\n",
      "away to the limits of the horizon, and melted in the distance in a\r\n",
      "faint haze. There within three square miles were accumulated the\r\n",
      "materials for a complete history of the animal life of ages, a\r\n",
      "history scarcely outlined in the too recent strata of the inhabited\r\n",
      "world.\r\n",

      "But an impatient curiosity impelled our steps; crackling and\r\n",

      "of rivalry and contention between the museums of great cities. A\r\n",
      "thousand Cuviers could never have reconstructed the organic remains\r\n",
      "deposited in this magnificent and unparalleled collection.\r\n",

      "mericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons,\r\n",

      "English called this 'trial of a jawbone.' To the geologists of the\r\n",
      "United Kingdom, who believed in the certainty of the fact--Messrs.\r\n",
      "Falconer, Busk, Carpenter, and others--scientific Germans were soon\r\n",
      "joined, and amongst them the forwardest, the most fiery, and the most\r\n",
      "enthusiastic, was my uncle Liedenbrock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary\r\n",
      "period seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in M.\r\n",
      "Elie de Beaumont. This high authority maintained that the soil of\r\n",
      "Moulin Quignon was not diluvial at all, but was of much more recent\r\n",
      "formation; and, agreeing in that with Cuvier, he refused to admit\r\n",
      "that the human species could be contemporary with the animals of the\r\n",
      "quaternary period. My uncle Liedenbrock, along with the great body of\r\n",
      "the geologists, had maintained his ground, disputed, and argued,\r\n",
      "until M. Elie de Beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We knew all these details, but we were not aware that since our\r\n",
      "departure the question had advanced to farther stages. Other similar\r\n",
      "maxillaries, though belonging to individuals of various types and\r\n",
      "different nations, were found in the loose grey soil of certain\r\n",
      "grottoes in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, as well as weapons,\r\n",
      "tools, earthen utensils, bones of children and adults. The existence\r\n",
      "therefore of man in the quaternary period seemed to become daily more\r\n",
      "certain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor was this all. Fresh discoveries of remains in the pleiocene\r\n",
      "formation had emboldened other geologists to refer back the human\r\n",
      "species to a higher antiquity still. It is true that these remains\r\n",
      "were not human bones, but objects bearing the traces of his\r\n",
      "handiwork, such as fossil leg-bones of animals, sculptured and carved\r\n",
      "evidently by the hand of man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus, at one bound, the record of the existence of man receded far\r\n",
      "back into the history of the ages past; he was a predecessor of the\r\n",
      "mastodon; he was a contemporary of the southern elephant; he lived a\r\n",
      "hundred thousand years ago, when, according to geologists, the\r\n",
      "pleiocene formation was in progress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such then was the state of palæontological science, and what we knew\r\n",
      "of it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this\r\n",
      "stupendous Golgotha. Any one may now understand the frenzied\r\n",
      "excitement of my uncle, when, twenty yards farther on, he found\r\n",
      "himself face to face with a primitive man!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a perfectly recognisable human body. Had some particular soil,\r\n",
      "like that of the cemetery St. Michel, at Bordeaux, preserved it thus\r\n",
      "for so many ages? It might be so. But this dried corpse, with its\r\n",
      "parchment-like skin drawn tightly over the bony frame, the limbs\r\n",
      "still preserving their shape, sound teeth, abundant hair, and finger\r\n",
      "and toe nails of frightful length, this desiccated mummy startled us\r\n",
      "by appearing just as it had lived countless ages ago. I stood mute\r\n",
      "before this apparition of remote antiquity. My uncle, usually so\r\n",
      "garrulous, was struck dumb likewise. We raised the body. We stood it\r\n",
      "up against a rock. It seemed to stare at us out of its empty orbits.\r\n",
      "We sounded with our knuckles his hollow frame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After some moments' silence the Professor was himself again. Otto\r\n",
      "Liedenbrock, yielding to his nature, forgot all the circumstances of\r\n",
      "our eventful journey, forgot where we were standing, forgot the\r\n",
      "vaulted cavern which contained us. No doubt he was in mind back again\r\n",
      "in his Johannæum, holding forth to his pupils, for he assumed his\r\n",

      "their fingers, and would be obliged to acknowledge their error. I am\r\n",
      "quite aware that science has to be on its guard with discoveries of\r\n",

      "remarkable than the bones of the mammoth and other mammals of the\r\n",
      "post-tertiary period. But in the presence of this specimen to doubt\r\n",
      "would be to insult science. There stands the body! You may see it,\r\n",

      "We had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones.\r\n",

      "We advanced in silence, bathed in luminous electric fluid. By some\r\n",
      "phenomenon which I am unable to explain, it lighted up all sides of\r\n",
      "every object equally. Such was its diffusiveness, there being no\r\n",
      "central point from which the light emanated, that shadows no longer\r\n",
      "existed. You might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical\r\n",
      "sun in a tropical region at noonday and the height of summer. No\r\n",
      "vapour was visible. The rocks, the distant mountains, a few isolated\r\n",
      "clumps of forest trees in the distance, presented a weird and\r\n",
      "wonderful aspect under these totally new conditions of a universal\r\n",
      "diffusion of light. We were like Hoffmann's shadowless man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest, but\r\n",
      "not one of those forests of fungi which bordered Port Gräuben.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here was the vegetation of the tertiary period in its fullest blaze\r\n",
      "of magnificence. Tall palms, belonging to species no longer living,\r\n",
      "splendid palmacites, firs, yews, cypress trees, thujas,\r\n",
      "representatives of the conifers, were linked together by a tangled\r\n",
      "network of long climbing plants. A soft carpet of moss and hepaticas\r\n",
      "luxuriously clothed the soil. A few sparkling streams ran almost in\r\n",
      "silence under what would have been the shade of the trees, but that\r\n",
      "there was no shadow. On their banks grew tree-ferns similar to those\r\n",
      "we grow in hothouses. But a remarkable feature was the total absence\r\n",
      "of colour in all those trees, shrubs, and plants, growing without the\r\n",
      "life-giving heat and light of the sun. Everything seemed mixed-up and\r\n",
      "confounded in one uniform silver grey or light brown tint like that\r\n",
      "of fading and faded leaves. Not a green leaf anywhere, and the\r\n",
      "flowers--which were abundant enough in the tertiary period, which\r\n",
      "first gave birth to flowers--looked like brown-paper flowers,\r\n",
      "without colour or scent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle Liedenbrock ventured to penetrate under this colossal grove.\r\n",
      "I followed him, not without fear. Since nature had here provided\r\n",
      "vegetable nourishment, why should not the terrible mammals be there\r\n",
      "too? I perceived in the broad clearings left by fallen trees, decayed\r\n",
      "with age, leguminose plants, acerineæ, rubiceæ and many other eatable\r\n",
      "shrubs, dear to ruminant animals at every period. Then I observed,\r\n",
      "mingled together in confusion, trees of countries far apart on the\r\n",
      "surface of the globe. The oak and the palm were growing side by side,\r\n",
      "the Australian eucalyptus leaned against the Norwegian pine, the\r\n",
      "birch-tree of the north mingled its foliage with New Zealand kauris.\r\n",
      "It was enough to distract the most ingenious classifier of\r\n",
      "terrestrial botany.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly I halted. I drew back my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and\r\n",
      "distant thickets. I had thought I saw--no! I did see, with my own\r\n",
      "eyes, vast colossal forms moving amongst the trees. They were\r\n",
      "gigantic animals; it was a herd of mastodons--not fossil remains,\r\n",
      "but living and resembling those the bones of which were found in the\r\n",
      "marshes of Ohio in 1801. I saw those huge elephants whose long,\r\n",
      "flexible trunks were grouting and turning up the soil under the trees\r\n",
      "like a legion of serpents. I could hear the crashing noise of their\r\n",
      "long ivory tusks boring into the old decaying trunks. The boughs\r\n",
      "cracked, and the leaves torn away by cartloads went down the\r\n",
      "cavernous throats of the vast brutes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, then, the dream in which I had had a vision of the prehistoric\r\n",

      "In fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the\r\n",

      "supernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I\r\n",
      "must conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been\r\n",

      "that discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this\r\n",

      "paces farther on, the arrangement of the cliffs, the appearance of an\r\n",
      "unrecognised stream, or the strange outline of a rock, came to throw\r\n",
      "me again into doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I communicated my doubts to my uncle. Like myself, he hesitated; he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Evidently,\" said I, \"we have not landed again at our original\r\n",
      "starting point, but the storm has carried us a little higher, and if\r\n",
      "we follow the shore we shall find Port Gräuben.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If that is the case it will be useless to continue our exploration,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It is difficult to speak decidedly, uncle, for all these rocks are\r\n",
      "so very much alike. Yet I think I recognise the promontory at the\r\n",
      "foot of which Hans constructed our launch. We must be very near the\r\n",
      "little port, if indeed this is not it,\" I added, examining a creek\r\n",
      "which I thought I recognised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Axel, we should at least find our own traces and I see nothing--\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, this is strange!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Axel, it is very simple. The Icelanders often wear arms of this\r\n",
      "kind. This must have belonged to Hans, and he has lost it.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Did it not belong to some pre-adamite warrior?\" I cried, \"to some\r\n",
      "living man, contemporary with the huge cattle-driver? But no. This is\r\n",
      "not a relic of the stone age. It is not even of the iron age. This\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Be calm, Axel, and reasonable. This dagger belongs to the sixteenth\r\n",
      "century; it is a poniard, such as gentlemen carried in their belts to\r\n",
      "give the coup _de grace._ Its origin is Spanish. It was never either\r\n",
      "yours, or mine, or the hunter's, nor did it belong to any of those\r\n",
      "human beings who may or may not inhabit this inner world. See, it was\r\n",
      "never jagged like this by cutting men's throats; its blade is coated\r\n",
      "with a rust neither a day, nor a year, nor a hundred years old.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "The wind was unfavourable to a species of launch not calculated for\r\n",

      "with iron-pointed sticks. Often the sunken rocks just beneath the\r\n",
      "surface obliged us to deviate from our straight course. At last,\r\n",
      "after three hours' sailing, about six in the evening we reached a\r\n",
      "place suitable for our landing. I jumped ashore, followed by my uncle\r\n",
      "and the Icelander. This short passage had not served to cool my\r\n",
      "ardour. On the contrary, I even proposed to burn 'our ship,' to\r\n",

      "gallery, to see if we shall require our ladders.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle put his Ruhmkorff's apparatus in action; the raft moored to\r\n",
      "the shore was left alone; the mouth of the tunnel was not twenty\r\n",
      "yards from us; and our party, with myself at the head, made for it\r\n",
      "without a moment's delay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The aperture, which was almost round, was about five feet in\r\n",
      "diameter; the dark passage was cut out in the live rock and lined\r\n",
      "with a coat of the eruptive matter which formerly issued from it; the\r\n",
      "interior was level with the ground outside, so that we were able to\r\n",
      "enter without difficulty. We were following a horizontal plane, when,\r\n",
      "only six paces in, our progress was interrupted by an enormous block\r\n",
      "just across our way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Accursed rock!\" I cried in a passion, finding myself suddenly\r\n",
      "confronted by an impassable obstacle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Right and left we searched in vain for a way, up and down, side to\r\n",
      "side; there was no getting any farther. I felt fearfully\r\n",
      "disappointed, and I would not admit that the obstacle was final. I\r\n",
      "stopped, I looked underneath the block: no opening. Above: granite\r\n",
      "still. Hans passed his lamp over every portion of the barrier in\r\n",
      "vain. We must give up all hope of passing it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down in despair. My uncle strode from side to side in the\r\n",
      "narrow passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no,\" I replied with animation. \"This fragment of rock has been\r\n",
      "shaken down by some shock or convulsion, or by one of those magnetic\r\n",
      "storms which agitate these regions, and has blocked up the passage\r\n",
      "which lay open to him. Many years have elapsed since the return of\r\n",
      "Saknussemm to the surface and the fall of this huge fragment. Is it\r\n",
      "not evident that this gallery was once the way open to the course of\r\n",
      "the lava, and that at that time there must have been a free passage?\r\n",
      "See here are recent fissures grooving and channelling the granite\r\n",
      "roof. This roof itself is formed of fragments of rock carried down,\r\n",
      "of enormous stones, as if by some giant's hand; but at one time the\r\n",
      "expulsive force was greater than usual, and this block, like the\r\n",
      "falling keystone of a ruined arch, has slipped down to the ground and\r\n",
      "blocked up the way. It is only an accidental obstruction, not met by\r\n",
      "Saknussemm, and if we don't destroy it we shall be unworthy to reach\r\n",
      "the centre of the earth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such was my sentence! The soul of the Professor had passed into me.\r\n",
      "The genius of discovery possessed me wholly. I forgot the past, I\r\n",
      "scorned the future. I gave not a thought to the things of the surface\r\n",
      "of this globe into which I had dived; its cities and its sunny\r\n",
      "plains, Hamburg and the Königstrasse, even poor Gräuben, who must\r\n",

      "After a hasty meal, my uncle and the hunter embarked whilst I\r\n",

      "a great gulf had opened; and the sea, now changed into a torrent, was\r\n",
      "hurrying us along into it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I gave myself up for lost.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour passed away--two hours, perhaps--I cannot tell. We clutched\r\n",
      "each other fast, to save ourselves from being thrown off the raft. We\r\n",
      "felt violent shocks whenever we were borne heavily against the craggy\r\n",
      "projections. Yet these shocks were not very frequent, from which I\r\n",
      "concluded that the gully was widening. It was no doubt the same road\r\n",
      "that Saknussemm had taken; but instead of walking peaceably down it,\r\n",
      "as he had done, we were carrying a whole sea along with us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These ideas, it will be understood, presented themselves to my mind\r\n",
      "in a vague and undetermined form. I had difficulty in associating any\r\n",
      "ideas together during this headlong race, which seemed like a\r\n",
      "vertical descent. To judge by the air which was whistling past me and\r\n",
      "made a whizzing in my ears, we were moving faster than the fastest\r\n",
      "express trains. To light a torch under these' conditions would have\r\n",
      "been impossible; and our last electric apparatus had been shattered\r\n",
      "by the force of the explosion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was therefore much surprised to see a clear light shining near me.\r\n",
      "It lighted up the calm and unmoved countenance of Hans. The skilful\r\n",
      "huntsman had succeeded in lighting the lantern; and although it\r\n",
      "flickered so much as to threaten to go out, it threw a fitful light\r\n",
      "across the awful darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was right in my supposition. It was a wide gallery. The dim light\r\n",
      "could not show us both its walls at once. The fall of the waters\r\n",
      "which were carrying us away exceeded that of the swiftest rapids in\r\n",
      "American rivers. Its surface seemed composed of a sheaf of arrows\r\n",
      "hurled with inconceivable force; I cannot convey my impressions by a\r\n",
      "better comparison. The raft, occasionally seized by an eddy, spun\r\n",
      "round as it still flew along. When it approached the walls of the\r\n",
      "gallery I threw on them the light of the lantern, and I could judge\r\n",
      "somewhat of the velocity of our speed by noticing how the jagged\r\n",
      "projections of the rocks spun into endless ribbons and bands, so that\r\n",
      "we seemed confined within a network of shifting lines. I supposed we\r\n",
      "were running at the rate of thirty leagues an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle and I gazed on each other with haggard eyes, clinging to the\r\n",
      "stump of the mast, which had snapped asunder at the first shock of\r\n",
      "our great catastrophe. We kept our backs to the wind, not to be\r\n",
      "stifled by the rapidity of a movement which no human power could\r\n",
      "check.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hours passed away. No change in our situation; but a discovery came\r\n",
      "to complicate matters and make them worse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In seeking to put our cargo into somewhat better order, I found that\r\n",
      "the greater part of the articles embarked had disappeared at the\r\n",
      "moment of the explosion, when the sea broke in upon us with such\r\n",
      "violence. I wanted to know exactly what we had saved, and with the\r\n",
      "lantern in my hand I began my examination. Of our instruments none\r\n",
      "were saved but the compass and the chronometer; our stock of ropes\r\n",
      "and ladders was reduced to the bit of cord rolled round the stump of\r\n",
      "the mast! Not a spade, not a pickaxe, not a hammer was left us; and,\r\n",
      "irreparable disaster! we had only one day's provisions left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I searched every nook and corner, every crack and cranny in the raft.\r\n",
      "There was nothing. Our provisions were reduced to one bit of salt\r\n",
      "meat and a few biscuits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stared at our failing supplies stupidly. I refused to take in the\r\n",
      "gravity of our loss. And yet what was the use of troubling myself. If\r\n",
      "we had had provisions enough for months, how could we get out of the\r\n",
      "abyss into which we were being hurled by an irresistible torrent? Why\r\n",
      "should we fear the horrors of famine, when death was swooping down\r\n",
      "upon us in a multitude of other forms? Would there be time left to\r\n",
      "die of starvation?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet by an inexplicable play of the imagination I forgot my present\r\n",
      "dangers, to contemplate the threatening future. Was there any chance\r\n",
      "of escaping from the fury of this impetuous torrent, and of returning\r\n",
      "to the surface of the globe? I could not form the slightest\r\n",
      "conjecture how or when. But one chance in a thousand, or ten\r\n",
      "thousand, is still a chance; whilst death from starvation would leave\r\n",
      "us not the smallest hope in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thought came into my mind to declare the whole truth to my uncle,\r\n",
      "to show him the dreadful straits to which we were reduced, and to\r\n",
      "calculate how long we might yet expect to live. But I had the courage\r\n",
      "to preserve silence. I wished to leave him cool and self-possessed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment the light from our lantern began to sink by little and\r\n",
      "little, and then went out entirely. The wick had burnt itself out.\r\n",
      "Black night reigned again; and there was no hope left of being able\r\n",
      "to dissipate the palpable darkness. We had yet a torch left, but we\r\n",
      "could not have kept it alight. Then, like a child, I closed my eyes\r\n",
      "firmly, not to see the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a considerable lapse of time our speed redoubled. I could\r\n",
      "perceive it by the sharpness of the currents that blew past my face.\r\n",
      "The descent became steeper. I believe we were no longer sliding, but\r\n",
      "falling down. I had an impression that we were dropping vertically.\r\n",
      "My uncle's hand, and the vigorous arm of Hans, held me fast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly, after a space of time that I could not measure, I felt a\r\n",
      "shock. The raft had not struck against any hard resistance, but had\r\n",
      "suddenly been checked in its fall. A waterspout, an immense liquid\r\n",
      "column, was beating upon the surface of the waters. I was\r\n",
      "suffocating! I was drowning!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this sudden flood was not of long duration. In a few seconds I\r\n",
      "found myself in the air again, which I inhaled with all the force of\r\n",
      "my lungs. My uncle and Hans were still holding me fast by the arms;\r\n",
      "and the raft was still carrying us.\r\n",

      "All at once I could hear; and it was a real exercise of the sense of\r\n",

      "I stretched out my arm. I touched the wall, and drew back my hand\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"The torch! The torch!\" cried the Professor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not without difficulty Hans succeeded in lighting the torch; and the\r\n",
      "flame, preserving its upward tendency, threw enough light to show us\r\n",
      "what kind of a place we were in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just as I thought,\" said the Professor \"We are in a tunnel not\r\n",
      "four-and-twenty feet in diameter. The water had reached the bottom of\r\n",
      "the gulf. It is now rising to its level, and carrying us with it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where to?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot tell; but we must be ready for anything. We are mounting at\r\n",
      "a speed which seems to me of fourteen feet in a second, or ten miles\r\n",
      "an hour. At this rate we shall get on.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, if nothing stops us; if this well has an aperture. But suppose\r\n",
      "it to be stopped. If the air is condensed by the pressure of this\r\n",
      "column of water we shall be crushed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Axel,\" replied the Professor with perfect coolness, \"our situation\r\n",
      "is almost desperate; but there are some chances of deliverance, and\r\n",
      "it is these that I am considering. If at every instant we may perish,\r\n",

      "mournfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!\" cried my uncle. \"Have we lost our provisions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; here is all we have left; one bit of salt meat for the three.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle stared at me as if he could not understand.\r\n",

      "wretched remnant of our goodly store.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But now we were mounting up with excessive speed. Sometimes the air\r\n",
      "would cut our breath short, as is experienced by aeronauts ascending\r\n",
      "too rapidly. But whilst they suffer from cold in proportion to their\r\n",
      "rise, we were beginning to feel a contrary effect. The heat was\r\n",
      "increasing in a manner to cause us the most fearful anxiety, and\r\n",
      "certainly the temperature was at this moment at the height of 100°\r\n",
      "Fahr.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What could be the meaning of such a change? Up to this time facts had\r\n",
      "supported the theories of Davy and of Liedenbrock; until now\r\n",
      "particular conditions of non-conducting rocks, electricity and\r\n",
      "magnetism, had tempered the laws of nature, giving us only a\r\n",
      "moderately warm climate, for the theory of a central fire remained in\r\n",
      "my estimation the only one that was true and explicable. Were we then\r\n",
      "turning back to where the phenomena of central heat ruled in all\r\n",
      "their rigour and would reduce the most refractory rocks to the state\r\n",
      "of a molten liquid? I feared this, and said to the Professor:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If we are neither drowned, nor shattered to pieces, nor starved to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Determine on what?\" said I.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, we must recruit our strength by carefully rationing ourselves,\r\n",

      "\"Nothing, Axel, nothing at all. But will it do you any more good to\r\n",

      "it neither sense nor energy.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Eat what is left to the last crumb, and recruit our fading strength.\r\n",
      "This meal will be our last, perhaps: so let it be! But at any rate we\r\n",

      "\"Well, let us consume it then,\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle took the piece of meat and the few biscuits which had\r\n",
      "escaped from the general destruction. He divided them into three\r\n",
      "equal portions and gave one to each. This made about a pound of\r\n",
      "nourishment for each. The Professor ate his greedily, with a kind of\r\n",
      "feverish rage. I ate without pleasure, almost with disgust; Hans\r\n",
      "quietly, moderately, masticating his small mouthfuls without any\r\n",
      "noise, and relishing them with the calmness of a man above all\r\n",
      "anxiety about the future. By diligent search he had found a flask of\r\n",
      "Hollands; he offered it to us each in turn, and this generous\r\n",
      "beverage cheered us up slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Forträfflig,_\" said Hans, drinking in his turn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Excellent,\" replied my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A glimpse of hope had returned, although without cause. But our last\r\n",
      "meal was over, and it was now five in the morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Man is so constituted that health is a purely negative state. Hunger\r\n",
      "once satisfied, it is difficult for a man to imagine the horrors of\r\n",
      "starvation; they cannot be understood without being felt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Therefore it was that after our long fast these few mouthfuls of meat\r\n",
      "and biscuit made us triumph over our past agonies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as soon as the meal was done, we each of us fell deep into\r\n",
      "thought. What was Hans thinking of--that man of the far West, but\r\n",
      "who seemed ruled by the fatalist doctrines of the East?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for me, my thoughts were made up of remembrances, and they carried\r\n",
      "me up to the surface of the globe of which I ought never to have\r\n",
      "taken leave. The house in the Königstrasse, my poor dear Gräuben,\r\n",
      "that kind soul Martha, flitted like visions before my eyes, and in\r\n",
      "the dismal moanings which from time to time reached my ears I thought\r\n",

      "earth.\r\n",

      "This calculation could, at best, be but a vague approximation; but a\r\n",
      "learned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining\r\n",
      "cool, and assuredly Professor Liedenbrock possessed this quality to a\r\n",
      "surprising degree.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could hear him murmuring geological terms. I could understand them,\r\n",

      "study.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eruptive granite,\" he was saying. \"We are still in the primitive\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Ah! who can tell? With his hand he was examining the perpendicular\r\n",
      "wall, and in a few more minutes he continued:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Still the temperature kept rising, and I felt myself steeped in a\r\n",
      "broiling atmosphere. I could only compare it to the heat of a furnace\r\n",
      "at the moment when the molten metal is running into the mould.\r\n",

      "my mind, but which was fast hardening into certainty. I tried to\r\n",
      "repel it, but it would return. I dared not express it in plain terms.\r\n",
      "Yet a few involuntary observations confirmed me in my view. By the\r\n",
      "flickering light of the torch I could distinguish contortions in the\r\n",
      "granite beds; a phenomenon was unfolding in which electricity would\r\n",
      "play the principal part; then this unbearable heat, this boiling\r\n",

      "But other facts, other circumstances, of a peculiar nature, came to\r\n",
      "reveal to me by degrees the true state of the case. There came\r\n",
      "incessant and continuous explosions. I could only compare them to the\r\n",
      "loud rattle of a long train of chariots driven at full speed over the\r\n",
      "stones, or a roar of unintermitting thunder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the disordered compass, thrown out of gear by the electric\r\n",
      "currents, confirmed me in a growing conviction. The mineral crust of\r\n",
      "the globe threatened to burst up, the granite foundations to come\r\n",
      "together with a crash, the fissure through which we were helplessly\r\n",
      "driven would be filled up, the void would be full of crushed\r\n",
      "fragments of rock, and we poor wretched mortals were to be buried and\r\n",
      "annihilated in this dreadful consummation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My uncle,\" I cried, \"we are lost now, utterly lost!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What are you in a fright about now?\" was the calm rejoinder. \"What\r\n",
      "is the matter with you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The matter? Look at those quaking walls! look at those shivering\r\n",
      "rocks. Don't you feel the burning heat? Don't you see how the water\r\n",
      "boils and bubbles? Are you blind to the dense vapours and steam\r\n",
      "growing thicker and denser every minute? See this agitated compass\r\n",
      "needle. It is an earthquake that is threatening us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My undaunted uncle calmly shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you think,\" said he, \"an earthquake is coming?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I think you are mistaken.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! don't you recognise the symptoms?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of an earthquake? no! I am looking out for something better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What can you mean? Explain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is an eruption, Axel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An eruption! Do you mean to affirm that we are running up the shaft\r\n",
      "of a volcano?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I believe we are,\" said the indomitable Professor with an air of\r\n",
      "perfect self-possession; \"and it is the best thing that could\r\n",
      "possibly happen to us under our circumstances.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The best thing! Was my uncle stark mad? What did the man mean? and\r\n",
      "what was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!\" I shouted. \"Are we being taken up in an eruption? Our fate\r\n",
      "has flung us here among burning lavas, molten rocks, boiling waters,\r\n",
      "and all kinds of volcanic matter; we are going to be pitched out,\r\n",
      "expelled, tossed up, vomited, spit out high into the air, along with\r\n",
      "fragments of rock, showers of ashes and scoria, in the midst of a\r\n",
      "towering rush of smoke and flames; and it is the best thing that\r\n",
      "could happen to us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, eyeing me over his spectacles, \"I don't\r\n",
      "see any other way of reaching the surface of the earth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I pass rapidly over the thousand ideas which passed through my mind.\r\n",
      "My uncle was right, undoubtedly right; and never had he seemed to me\r\n",
      "more daring and more confirmed in his notions than at this moment\r\n",
      "when he was calmly contemplating the chances of being shot out of a\r\n",
      "volcano!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the meantime up we went; the night passed away in continual\r\n",
      "ascent; the din and uproar around us became more and more\r\n",
      "intensified; I was stifled and stunned; I thought my last hour was\r\n",
      "approaching; and yet imagination is such a strong thing that even in\r\n",
      "this supreme hour I was occupied with strange and almost childish\r\n",
      "speculations. But I was the victim, not the master, of my own\r\n",
      "thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was very evident that we were being hurried upward upon the crest\r\n",
      "of a wave of eruption; beneath our raft were boiling waters, and\r\n",
      "under these the more sluggish lava was working its way up in a heated\r\n",
      "mass, together with shoals of fragments of rock which, when they\r\n",
      "arrived at the crater, would be dispersed in all directions high and\r\n",
      "low. We were imprisoned in the shaft or chimney of some volcano.\r\n",
      "There was no room to doubt of that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this time, instead of Snæfell, an extinct volcano, we were inside\r\n",
      "one in full activity. I wondered, therefore, where could this\r\n",
      "mountain be, and in what part of the world we were to be shot out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I made no doubt but that it would be in some northern region. Before\r\n",
      "its disorders set in, the needle had never deviated from that\r\n",
      "direction. From Cape Saknussemm we had been carried due north for\r\n",
      "hundreds of leagues. Were we under Iceland again? Were we destined to\r\n",
      "be thrown up out of Hecla, or by which of the seven other fiery\r\n",
      "craters in that island? Within a radius of five hundred leagues to\r\n",
      "the west I remembered under this parallel of latitude only the\r\n",
      "imperfectly known volcanoes of the north-east coast of America. To\r\n",
      "the east there was only one in the 80th degree of north latitude, the\r\n",
      "Esk in Jan Mayen Island, not far from Spitzbergen! Certainly there\r\n",
      "was no lack of craters, and there were some capacious enough to throw\r\n",
      "out a whole army! But I wanted to know which of them was to serve us\r\n",
      "for an exit from the inner world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards morning the ascending movement became accelerated. If the\r\n",
      "heat increased, instead of diminishing, as we approached nearer to\r\n",
      "the surface of the globe, this effect was due to local causes alone,\r\n",
      "and those volcanic. The manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my\r\n",
      "mind. An enormous force, a force of hundreds of atmospheres,\r\n",
      "generated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours, was driving us\r\n",
      "irresistibly forward. But to what numberless dangers it exposed us!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which\r\n",
      "widened as we went up. Right and left I could see deep channels, like\r\n",
      "huge tunnels, out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke; tongues of\r\n",
      "fire lapped the walls, which crackled and sputtered under the intense\r\n",
      "heat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See, see, my uncle!\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, those are only sulphureous flames and vapours, which one must\r\n",
      "expect to see in an eruption. They are quite natural.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But suppose they should wrap us round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But they won't wrap us round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But we shall be stifled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall not be stifled at all. The gallery is widening, and if it\r\n",
      "becomes necessary, we shall abandon the raft, and creep into a\r\n",
      "crevice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the water--the rising water?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is no more water, Axel; only a lava paste, which is bearing us\r\n",
      "up on its surface to the top of the crater.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The liquid column had indeed disappeared, to give place to dense and\r\n",
      "still boiling eruptive matter of all kinds. The temperature was\r\n",
      "becoming unbearable. A thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would\r\n",
      "have marked 150°. The perspiration streamed from my body. But for the\r\n",
      "rapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the Professor gave up his idea of abandoning the raft, and it was\r\n",
      "well he did. However roughly joined together, those planks afforded\r\n",
      "us a firmer support than we could have found anywhere else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About eight in the morning a new incident occurred. The upward\r\n",
      "movement ceased. The raft lay motionless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is this?\" I asked, shaken by this sudden stoppage as if by a\r\n",
      "shock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is a halt,\" replied my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is the eruption checked?\" I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rose, and tried to look around me. Perhaps the raft itself, stopped\r\n",
      "in its course by a projection, was staying the volcanic torrent. If\r\n",
      "this were the case we should have to release it as soon as possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was not so. The blast of ashes, scorix, and rubbish had ceased\r\n",
      "to rise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has the eruption stopped?\" I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said my uncle between his clenched teeth, \"you are afraid. But\r\n",
      "don't alarm yourself--this lull cannot last long. It has lasted now\r\n",
      "five minutes, and in a short time we shall resume our journey to the\r\n",
      "mouth of the crater.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he spoke, the Professor continued to consult his chronometer, and\r\n",
      "he was again right in his prognostications. The raft was soon hurried\r\n",
      "and driven forward with a rapid but irregular movement, which lasted\r\n",
      "about ten minutes, and then stopped again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very good,\" said my uncle; \"in ten minutes more we shall be off\r\n",
      "again, for our present business lies with an intermittent volcano. It\r\n",
      "gives us time now and then to take breath.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was perfectly true. When the ten minutes were over we started\r\n",
      "off again with renewed and increased speed. We were obliged to lay\r\n",
      "fast hold of the planks of the raft, not to be thrown off. Then again\r\n",
      "the paroxysm was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have since reflected upon this singular phenomenon without being\r\n",
      "able to explain it. At any rate it was clear that we were not in the\r\n",
      "main shaft of the volcano, but in a lateral gallery where there were\r\n",
      "felt recurrent tunes of reaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How often this operation was repeated I cannot say. All I know is,\r\n",
      "that at each fresh impulse we were hurled forward with a greatly\r\n",
      "increased force, and we seemed as if we were mere projectiles. During\r\n",
      "the short halts we were stifled with the heat; whilst we were being\r\n",
      "projected forward the hot air almost stopped my breath. I thought for\r\n",
      "a moment how delightful it would be to find myself carried suddenly\r\n",
      "into the arctic regions, with a cold 30° below the freezing point. My\r\n",
      "overheated brain conjured up visions of white plains of cool snow,\r\n",
      "where I might roll and allay my feverish heat. Little by little my\r\n",
      "brain, weakened by so many constantly repeated shocks, seemed to be\r\n",
      "giving way altogether. But for the strong arm of Hans I should more\r\n",
      "than once have had my head broken against the granite roof of our\r\n",
      "burning dungeon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have therefore no exact recollection of what took place during the\r\n",
      "following hours. I have a confused impression left of continuous\r\n",
      "explosions, loud detonations, a general shaking of the rocks all\r\n",
      "around us, and of a spinning movement with which our raft was once\r\n",
      "whirled helplessly round. It rocked upon the lava torrent, amidst a\r\n",
      "dense fall of ashes. Snorting flames darted their fiery tongues at\r\n",
      "us. There were wild, fierce puffs of stormy wind from below,\r\n",
      "resembling the blasts of vast iron furnaces blowing all at one time;\r\n",
      "and I caught a glimpse of the figure of Hans lighted up by the fire;\r\n",
      "and all the feeling I had left was just what I imagine must be the\r\n",
      "feeling of an unhappy criminal doomed to be blown away alive from the\r\n",
      "mouth of a cannon, just before the trigger is pulled, and the flying\r\n",
      "limbs and rags of flesh and skin fill the quivering air and spatter\r\n",
      "the blood-stained ground.\r\n",

      "When I opened my eyes again I felt myself grasped by the belt with\r\n",
      "the strong hand of our guide. With the other arm he supported my\r\n",
      "uncle. I was not seriously hurt, but I was shaken and bruised and\r\n",
      "battered all over. I found myself lying on the sloping side of a\r\n",
      "mountain only two yards from a gaping gulf, which would have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Hans must be mistaken,\" I said, raising myself up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was our final surprise after all the astonishing events of our\r\n",
      "wonderful journey. I expected to see a white cone covered with the\r\n",
      "eternal snow of ages rising from the midst of the barren deserts of\r\n",
      "the icy north, faintly lighted with the pale rays of the arctic sun,\r\n",
      "far away in the highest latitudes known; but contrary to all our\r\n",
      "expectations, my uncle, the Icelander, and myself were sitting\r\n",
      "half-way down a mountain baked under the burning rays of a southern\r\n",
      "sun, which was blistering us with the heat, and blinding us with the\r\n",
      "fierce light of his nearly vertical rays.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could not believe my own eyes; but the heated air and the sensation\r\n",
      "of burning left me no room for doubt. We had come out of the crater\r\n",
      "half naked, and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for\r\n",
      "two months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more\r\n",
      "of his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they\r\n",
      "had been so long strangers, I began to use them to set my imagination\r\n",
      "right. At least I would have it to be Spitzbergen, and I was in no\r\n",
      "humour to give up this notion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Professor was the first to speak, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, this is not much like Iceland.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But is it Jan Mayen?\" I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nor that either,\" he answered. \"This is no northern mountain; here\r\n",
      "are no granite peaks capped with snow. Look, Axel, look!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the\r\n",
      "crater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes\r\n",
      "or so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire,\r\n",
      "mingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the\r\n",
      "heaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale,\r\n",
      "and puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes. Beneath, down a\r\n",
      "pretty steep declivity, ran streams of lava for eight or nine hundred\r\n",
      "feet, giving the mountain a height of about 1,300 or 1,400 feet. But\r\n",
      "the base of the mountain was hidden in a perfect bower of rich\r\n",
      "verdure, amongst which I was able to distinguish the olive, the fig,\r\n",
      "and vines, covered with their luscious purple bunches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was forced to confess that there was nothing arctic here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the eye passed beyond these green surroundings it rested on a\r\n",
      "wide, blue expanse of sea or lake, which appeared to enclose this\r\n",
      "enchanting island, within a compass of only a few leagues. Eastward\r\n",
      "lay a pretty little white seaport town or village, with a few houses\r\n",
      "scattered around it, and in the harbour of which a few vessels of\r\n",
      "peculiar rig were gently swayed by the softly swelling waves. Beyond\r\n",
      "it, groups of islets rose from the smooth, blue waters, but in such\r\n",
      "numbers that they seemed to dot the sea like a shoal. To the west\r\n",
      "distant coasts lined the dim horizon, on some rose blue mountains of\r\n",
      "smooth, undulating forms; on a more distant coast arose a prodigious\r\n",
      "cone crowned on its summit with a snowy plume of white cloud. To the\r\n",
      "northward lay spread a vast sheet of water, sparkling and dancing\r\n",
      "under the hot, bright rays, the uniformity broken here and there by\r\n",
      "the topmast of a gallant ship appearing above the horizon, or a\r\n",
      "swelling sail moving slowly before the wind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This unforeseen spectacle was most charming to eyes long used to\r\n",
      "underground darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are we? Where are we?\" I asked faintly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hans closed his eyes with lazy indifference. What did it matter to\r\n",
      "him? My uncle looked round with dumb surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, whatever mountain this may be,\" he said at last, \"it is very\r\n",
      "hot here. The explosions are going on still, and I don't think it\r\n",
      "would look well to have come out by an eruption, and then to get our\r\n",
      "heads broken by bits of falling rock. Let us get down. Then we shall\r\n",
      "know better what we are about. Besides, I am starving, and parching\r\n",
      "with thirst.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Decidedly the Professor was not given to contemplation. For my part,\r\n",
      "I could for another hour or two have forgotten my hunger and my\r\n",
      "fatigue to enjoy the lovely scene before me; but I had to follow my\r\n",
      "companions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The slope of the volcano was in many places of great steepness. We\r\n",
      "slid down screes of ashes, carefully avoiding the lava streams which\r\n",
      "glided sluggishly by us like fiery serpents. As we went I chattered\r\n",
      "and asked all sorts of questions as to our whereabouts, for I was too\r\n",
      "much excited not to talk a great deal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We are in Asia,\" I cried, \"on the coasts of India, in the Malay\r\n",
      "Islands, or in Oceania. We have passed through half the globe, and\r\n",
      "come out nearly at the antipodes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the compass?\" said my uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay, the compass!\" I said, greatly puzzled. \"According to the compass\r\n",
      "we have gone northward.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has it lied?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Surely not. Could it lie?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Unless, indeed, this is the North Pole!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, no, it is not the Pole; but--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, here was something that baffled us completely. I could not tell\r\n",
      "what to say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But now we were coming into that delightful greenery, and I was\r\n",
      "suffering greatly from hunger and thirst. Happily, after two hours'\r\n",
      "walking, a charming country lay open before us, covered with olive\r\n",
      "trees, pomegranate trees, and delicious vines, all of which seemed to\r\n",
      "belong to anybody who pleased to claim them. Besides, in our state of\r\n",
      "destitution and famine we were not likely to be particular. Oh, the\r\n",
      "inexpressible pleasure of pressing those cool, sweet fruits to our\r\n",
      "lips, and eating grapes by mouthfuls off the rich, full bunches! Not\r\n",
      "far off, in the grass, under the delicious shade of the trees, I\r\n",
      "discovered a spring of fresh, cool water, in which we luxuriously\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "We were hardly thinking of that. Stromboli! What an effect this\r\n",
      "unexpected name produced upon my mind! We were in the midst of the\r\n",
      "Mediterranean Sea, on an island of the Æolian archipelago, in the\r\n",
      "ancient Strongyle, where Æolus kept the winds and the storms chained\r\n",
      "up, to be let loose at his will. And those distant blue mountains in\r\n",
      "the east were the mountains of Calabria. And that threatening volcano\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Stromboli, Stromboli!\" I repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My uncle kept time to my exclamations with hands and feet, as well as\r\n",
      "with words. We seemed to be chanting in chorus!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What a journey we had accomplished! How marvellous! Having entered by\r\n",
      "one volcano, we had issued out of another more than two thousand\r\n",
      "miles from Snæfell and from that barren, far-away Iceland! The\r\n",
      "strange chances of our expedition had carried us into the heart of\r\n",
      "the fairest region in the world. We had exchanged the bleak regions\r\n",
      "of perpetual snow and of impenetrable barriers of ice for those of\r\n",
      "brightness and 'the rich hues of all glorious things.' We had left\r\n",
      "over our heads the murky sky and cold fogs of the frigid zone to\r\n",
      "revel under the azure sky of Italy!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After our delicious repast of fruits and cold, clear water we set off\r\n",
      "again to reach the port of Stromboli. It would not have been wise to\r\n",
      "tell how we came there. The superstitious Italians would have set us\r\n",
      "down for fire-devils vomited out of hell; so we presented ourselves\r\n",
      "in the humble guise of shipwrecked mariners. It was not so glorious,\r\n",
      "but it was safer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On my way I could hear my uncle murmuring: \"But the compass! that\r\n",
      "compass! It pointed due north. How are we to explain that fact?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My opinion is,\" I replied disdainfully, \"that it is best not to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed, sir! The occupant of a professorial chair at the Johannæum\r\n",
      "unable to explain the reason of a cosmical phenomenon! Why, it would\r\n",
      "be simply disgraceful!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as he spoke, my uncle, half undressed, in rags, a perfect\r\n",
      "scarecrow, with his leathern belt around him, settling his spectacles\r\n",
      "upon his nose and looking learned and imposing, was himself again,\r\n",
      "the terrible German professor of mineralogy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One hour after we had left the grove of olives, we arrived at the\r\n",
      "little port of San Vicenzo, where Hans claimed his thirteen week's\r\n",
      "wages, which was counted out to him with a hearty shaking of hands\r\n",
      "all round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment, if he did not share our natural emotion, at least his\r\n",
      "countenance expanded in a manner very unusual with him, and while\r\n",
      "with the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands, I believe\r\n",

      "Such is the conclusion of a history which I cannot expect everybody\r\n",
      "to believe, for some people will believe nothing against the\r\n",
      "testimony of their own experience. However, I am indifferent to their\r\n",
      "incredulity, and they may believe as much or as little as they please.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Stromboliotes received us kindly as shipwrecked mariners. They\r\n",
      "gave us food and clothing. After waiting forty-eight hours, on the 31\r\n",
      "st of August, a small craft took us to Messina, where a few days'\r\n",
      "rest completely removed the effect of our fatigues.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Friday, September the 4th, we embarked on the steamer Volturno,\r\n",
      "employed by the French Messageries Imperiales, and in three days more\r\n",
      "we were at Marseilles, having no care on our minds except that\r\n",
      "abominable deceitful compass, which we had mislaid somewhere and\r\n",
      "could not now examine; but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my\r\n",
      "mind fearfully. On the 9th of September, in the evening, we arrived\r\n",
      "at Hamburg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I looked tenderly upon her, and she smiled through her tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How can I describe the extraordinary sensation produced by the return\r\n",
      "of Professor Liedenbrock? Thanks to Martha's ineradicable tattling,\r\n",
      "the news that the Professor had gone to discover a way to the centre\r\n",
      "of the earth had spread over the whole civilised world. People\r\n",
      "refused to believe it, and when they saw him they would not believe\r\n",
      "him any the more. Still, the appearance of Hans, and sundry pieces of\r\n",
      "intelligence derived from Iceland, tended to shake the confidence of\r\n",
      "the unbelievers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then my uncle became a great man, and I was now the nephew of a great\r\n",
      "man--which is not a privilege to be despised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hamburg gave a grand fete in our honour. A public audience was given\r\n",
      "to the Professor at the Johannæum, at which he told all about our\r\n",
      "expedition, with only one omission, the unexplained and inexplicable\r\n",
      "behaviour of our compass. On the same day, with much state, he\r\n",
      "deposited in the archives of the city the now famous document of\r\n",
      "Saknussemm, and expressed his regret that circumstances over which he\r\n",
      "had no control had prevented him from following to the very centre of\r\n",
      "the earth the track of the learned Icelander. He was modest\r\n",
      "notwithstanding his glory, and he was all the more famous for his\r\n",
      "humility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So much honour could not but excite envy. There were those who envied\r\n",
      "him his fame; and as his theories, resting upon known facts, were in\r\n",
      "opposition to the systems of science upon the question of the central\r\n",
      "fire, he sustained with his pen and by his voice remarkable\r\n",
      "discussions with the learned of every country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For my part I cannot agree with his theory of gradual cooling: in\r\n",
      "spite of what I have seen and felt, I believe, and always shall\r\n",
      "believe, in the central heat. But I admit that certain circumstances\r\n",
      "not yet sufficiently understood may tend to modify in places the\r\n",
      "action of natural phenomena.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While these questions were being debated with great animation, my\r\n",
      "uncle met with a real sorrow. Our faithful Hans, in spite of our\r\n",
      "entreaties, had left Hamburg; the man to whom we owed all our success\r\n",
      "and our lives too would not suffer us to reward him as we could have\r\n",
      "wished. He was seized with the mal de pays, a complaint for which we\r\n",
      "have not even a name in English.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Farval,_\" said he one day; and with that simple word he left us and\r\n",
      "sailed for Rejkiavik, which he reached in safety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were strongly attached to our brave eider-down hunter; though far\r\n",
      "away in the remotest north, he will never be forgotten by those whose\r\n",
      "lives he protected, and certainly I shall not fail to endeavour to\r\n",
      "see him once more before I die.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To conclude, I have to add that this 'Journey into the Interior of\r\n",
      "the Earth' created a wonderful sensation in the world. It was\r\n",
      "translated into all civilised languages. The leading newspapers\r\n",
      "extracted the most interesting passages, which were commented upon,\r\n",
      "picked to pieces, discussed, attacked, and defended with equal\r\n",
      "enthusiasm and determination, both by believers and sceptics. Rare\r\n",
      "privilege! my uncle enjoyed during his lifetime the glory he had\r\n",
      "deservedly won; and he may even boast the distinguished honour of an\r\n",
      "offer from Mr. Barnum, to exhibit him on most advantageous terms in\r\n",
      "all the principal cities in the United States!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there was one 'dead fly' amidst all this glory and honour; one\r\n",
      "fact, one incident, of the journey remained a mystery. Now to a man\r\n",
      "eminent for his learning, an unexplained phenomenon is an unbearable\r\n",
      "hardship. Well! it was yet reserved for my uncle to be completely\r\n",
      "happy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, while arranging a collection of minerals in his cabinet, I\r\n",
      "noticed in a corner this unhappy compass, which we had long lost\r\n",
      "sight of; I opened it, and began to watch it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been in that corner for six months, little mindful of the\r\n",
      "trouble it was giving.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, I noticed a strange fact, and I\r\n",
      "uttered a cry of surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" my uncle asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Yes, they point the wrong way.\"\r\n",

      "My uncle looked, he compared, and the house shook with his triumphant\r\n",
      "leap of exultation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A light broke in upon his spirit and mine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See there,\" he cried, as soon as he was able to speak. \"After our\r\n",
      "arrival at Cape Saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this\r\n",
      "confounded compass began to point south instead of north.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Evidently!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here, then, is the explanation of our mistake. But what phenomenon\r\n",
      "could have caused this reversal of the poles?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The reason is evident, uncle.\"\r\n",
